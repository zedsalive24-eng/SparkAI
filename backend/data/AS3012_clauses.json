For example, welding generators with auxiliary circuits supplying J 15 V a.c. that do  not originate from an isolated winding is required to be RCD protected as per Clause 2.4.6.3(c).  (a) Where a site switchboard is supplied directly by a generator all sub-mains and final  sub-circuits originating at that switchboard shall be protected in accordance with  Clauses 2.4.5 and 2.4.6.1 as illustrated in Figure 2.1.  (b) Isolated winding generators, connected in accordance with Figure 2.2, shall only be  used on construction and demolition sites to supply a separated circuit for electrical  equipment, installed in accordance with the electrical separation requirements of  AS/NZS 3000. Each winding shall supply not more than one item of Class I (earthed  conductive parts) electrical equipment.  NOTES:  One or more items of Class II (double insulated) electrical equipment may be connected  to an isolated winding generator.  2 Portable ReDs will not operate as there is no neutral to earth connection upstream of the  RCD.  3 In some jurisdictions, the use of isolated winding generators is not permitted on  construction and demolition sites.  4 The 2 pole switching shown in Figure 2.2 is required as both conductors are considered to  be live-neither is earthed in normal operation.  5 The connection of the generating set bonding system to the general mass of earth through  an earth electrode is not required or recommended as there is double insulation from the  live parts to the frame.  6 On Iy one Class I item (one is based on probability) is allowed as the first fault from a live  part to earth makes it a non-isolated system.  (c) Generators providing electrical supply via permanently connected RCDs with  maximum rated residual current of 30 rnA, operating in all live (active and neutral)  conductors, and connccted as per Figure 2.3, may be used to supply multiple items of  equipment.  NOTES:  The RCD protected system allows the use of multiple Class ( (metal frame with a bonding  conductor) items as the first fault causes a residual current device to trip.  2 The connection of the generating set bonding system to the general mass of earth through  an earth electrode is not required or recommended. At 240 V a current of30 mA will not  flow if the fault path resistance exceeds 8 kn. Without an earth electrode the current is  reduced, but an RCD will operate at 30 rnA irrespective of the arrangement. The  protection required is given without an electrode. It is considered the possible fault  current should be as low as practicable and hence an electrode should NOT be used.  3 Th is principle does not app Iy to the M EN system where the neutral is earthed at the  source and at multiple points. (See Figure 2.1).  4 The following examples of fault current paths and currents (see Figure 2.3) have been  considered when deciding an earth electrode is not required:  COPYRIGHT  15 AS/NZS 3012:2010  (a) A fault between I ive parts and the equipotentially bonded exposed conductive parts such  as the frame of a Class I appliance or from the internal live parts of Class II appliances  to the bonding system.  (b) The fault path is from the live conductor through the fault to the equipotentially bonded  system to the neutral. The current is likely to exceed 30 rnA. The magnitude of the  current is not influenced by the presence or absence of an earth electrode.  (c) Fault between live parts and the mass of earth:  (i) Example A: A generator on the back o/' a truck The fault path is from  the live parts to the mass of earth-through the insulation resistance of the  tyres and truck tray parts to the generator frame, which is connected to the  neutral.  The tyres are high resistance so the current is low and the situation IS  similar to an isolated system. The current is likely to be below 30 mA  (ii) Example B: A general or resting on lhe mass earth The fault path is  from the live parts to the mass of earth through the casual resistance of the  generator frame which is connected to the neutral.  The casual resistance of the generator frame to the mass of earth may be  low so the current may exceed 30 rnA.  (iii) Example C: A generator with an earth elecfrode The fault path is from the  live parts to the mass of earth through the resistance of the earth electrode  to the generator frame which is connected to the neutral.  The earth resistance is lower than for Example B and the current is likely to  exceed 30 mA.",

COPYRIGHT  AS/NZS 3012:2010 50  H2 VERIFICATION OF INVERTER SEPARATiON AND RCD OPERATION  H2.1 General  This Paragraph (H2) details tests for the verification of the electrical separation in isolated  inverters and for verification of the bonding and RCD operation in RCD protected inverters.  All tests shall be performed prior to the introduction of all inverters into service and at  intervals as specified in Paragraph H3.  H2.2 Electrical separation for isolated inverters  The inverter is connected to the rated supply voltage with no load and then with a load  connected to the output circuit.  A true rms reading volt meter, along with a parallel resistor, is connected from the battery  negative terminal to each of the following:  (a) The socket-outlet Active contact.  (b) The socket-outlet Neutral contact.  The voltage shall not exceed 25 V.  NOTE: The parallel resistor is to ensure the voltages are from a source with a sufficiently low  value of impedance that is capable of delivering a perception current to a person. A resistor in the  range 1.5 kf2 to 15 kf2 is suitable,  H2.3 Bonding and RCD operation for RCD protected inverters  H2.3.t Bonding test  The continuity is measured to ensure the battery negative, the inverter frame and the socket\u00ad outlet earth contact are connected together.  The value of resistance shall not exceed I Q.  H2.3.2 RCD lest  The inverter is connected to the rated supply voltage with no load and then with a load  connected to the output circuit.  (a) Functional te,st with the RCD test buttoll The button is pushed to initiate a trip of the  RCD. The RCD must trip without undue delay. The test is made 5 times.  (b) Residual current rating Operation at the rated residual current using a test resistor  and verification that the neutral-earth (or eentre tap) connection is upstream of the  RCD.  A resistor in series with a switch is connected from the socket-outlet active term inal to the  socket-outlet earth terminal. The RCD is closed and then the test switch is closed.  The RCD must trip without undue delay. The test is made 5 times.  NOTES:  The resistor is sized to give the rated residual current. For example, with a 230 V true rms  output with a rated residual current of 30 mA, the resistor should be 7.6 kf2. Other values are  given in the notes to Figure H2.  2 If an ReD tester is llsed it must be verified by the supplier as suitable for the output  waveform of the inverter.

This Appendix provides further information to supplement that covered in Clause 2.3  NOTE: This Appendix uses the AS/NZS 3439.4 term 'Assemblies for Construction Sites'. These  units may be known by the term 'Cascadable Reticulation Units' (CRU) in other Standards, e.g.  AS/NZS 3002.  K2 ALTERNATIVE SUPPLY SYSTEMS  K2.1 Installation and verification  (a) Australia and New Zealand require a qualified person for the installation and  verification of direct connected sub-mains and equipment  (b) Australia requires a qualified person for the installation and verification of sub-mains  (interconnecting cable) for plug and socket connected ACSs.  (c) New Zealand requires a competent person for the installation and verification of sub\u00ad mains (interconnecting cable) for plug and socket connected ACSs.  K3 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND FUNCTIONS OF ASSEMBLIES FOR  CONSTRUCTION SITES (ACS)  K3.1 General  All ACS shall comply with the requirements of ASiNZS 3439.4 and the relevant  requirements of this Standard.  K3.2 ACS description  An ACS system consisting of an incoming ACS unit and several outgoing ACS units is  shown in Figure K 1. Safety services shall be installed to the requirements of AS/NZS 3000.  The interconnecting cables are classified as sub-mains and may use direct or detachable  connections. The circuits within the units supplying socket-outlets and/or major items of  plant are classified as final sub-circuits.  Incoming and outgoing ACS units may incorporate additional units such as- (a) metering units;  (b) transformer units with low voltage 10 extra low voltage (LV /ELV) transformers to  provide SELV or PELV supplies; and  (c) transformer units with low voltage to low voltage (LV/LV) transformers to provide  separated (isolated) LV suppl ies.  An outgoing ACS unit may provide a supply to- (i) other ACS outgoing units;  (ii) lighting;  COPYRIGHT  (iii) machines or electric tools; or  (iv) other construction site equipment.  K3.3 ACS installation system  55 AS/NZS 3012:2010  A number of compatible ACS assemblies may be interconnected to form a complete  installation, or part of an installation. ACS assemblies shall provide basic protection  (protection against direct contact) from electric shock and, where possible, discrimination  by suitable selection of protective devices. For example. the breaking capacity. current  rating and operating time under fault conditions.  In Australia only, on the incoming supply fUllction unit for each floor of a multi-storey  construction the deta9hable incoming supply connections (both ends) shall be fitted with a  device requiring a key or tool for disconnection (detachment) and all other ACS units  connected to this unit shall be limited to that floor.  Exceplion: This requirement need not apply to work in !(ft shafis. slairwells, service shafis,  formwork or external staging.  K3.4 Assembly characteristics  The various assembly characteristics are laid down by the manufacturer, or are the subject  of an agreement between manufacturer and user, taking into account the nature of supply  and/or distribution network and relevant installation requirements. A single ACS assembly  may incorporate a number of functions.  K4 GENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF ACS ASSEMBLIES  K4.1 Transportable ACS unit  Assemblies that are intended for use in a place where they are not permanently fixed and  the location may vary during work on the site. When the transportable ACS is to be moved  to another location, it must be disconnected from the supply.  K4.2 Mobile ACS unit  Assemblies that are capable of being moved as work advances on the site. These may not  require disconnection from the supply when being relocated.  K4.3 Incoming ACS unit  (a) The cable connection facilities, terminals, connecting devices, connectors, or plug  and socket-outlet accessories shall be compatible with the current rating of the ACS  assembly.  (b) Incoming and outgoing isolating and over-current protective devices shall be  provided. There shall be means for securing these devices in the open position. The  protection shall be sized to ensure that, with the maximum earth fault loop impedance  to a socket-outlet on the most distant ACS, automatic disconnection of supply occurs  within 400 ms as per AS/NZS 3000, i.e. fault protection for indirect contact is  ensured.  (c) The incoming ACS assembly is typically a transportable ACS.  (d) The cabl ing to an incoming ACS shall be by direct connection.  (e) The connection to major items of plant shall be by direct connection from an  incoming ACS unit.  K4.4 Metering ACS unit  (a) The metering ACS assembly shall be designed by or in agreement with the electricity  distributor requirements if it is intended to use the metering device(s) to measure the  energy consumed for the purposes of payment for the energy consumed.  COPYRIGHT  ASfNZS 3012:2010 56  (b) The metering ACS assembly is typically a transportable ACS.  (c) The sub-main cabling to a metering ACS shall be by direct connection.  K4.5 Transformer ACS unit  K4.S.1 General  The transformer ACS unit includes a low-voltage to extra low-voltage (LV IELV)  transformer and/or a low-voltage to low-voltage transformer (LV/LV).  K4.5.2 LV/ELVACS unit  (a) The LV/ELV ACS unit provides either a SELV or PELV supply complying with  AS/NZS 3000 requirements.  (b) Each LV /EL V ACS un it consists of-- (i) the protective and control devices in the transformer primary circuit;  (ii) a ELV safety transformer complying with the requirements of AS/NZS 61558;  and  (iii) the protective devices, control switches and connection methods required for  the ELV output circuits as detailed in AS/NZS 3000.  (c) The LV/ELV ACS unit is typically a mobile ACS.  K4.S.3 LV/LV AeS unit  (a) The LV ILV ACS unit provides a separated (isolated) LV supply complying with  AS/NZS 3000 requirements.  (b) Each LV/LV ACS unit consists  (i) the protective and control devices on the transformer primary circuit;  (Ii) an LV/LV transformer, which shall be an isolating transformer complying with  AS/NZS 61558; and  (iii) the protective and control devices for the output circuit(s) and socket-outlets  shall be to AS/NZS 3000 requirements.  (c) '['he equipotential bonding of socket-outlet earth connections supplied by a common  isolating transformer secondary winding shall be to AS/NZS 3000 requirements.  (d) The LV /LV ACS unit is typically a mobile ACS.  K4.6 Outgoing ACS unit  (a) The outgoing ACS unit consists of one incoming and a number of outgoing circuits.  (b) There shall bc over-current protection, suitable for isolation, for the incoming and  outgoing supply.  Exception: The incoming over-current protection may be omitted if the ACS assemblJI  is directly connected 10 an upstream ACS assembly that is able to provide the  overcurrent protection required/or the downstream ACt)' assembly. However, a load  break isolator on the incoming supply is still required.  (c) The input isolation switch device shall be easily accessible without the use of a key or  tool.  (d) 'rhe input isolation switch shall operate simultaneously on all poles and switch all  active conductors.  COPYRIGHT  57 AS/NZS 3012:2010  (e) Additional protection of final sub-circuits shall comply with Clause 2.4.6 and 2.9.  (1)  NOTES:  To avoid unwanted tripping because of leakage currents and transient disturbances, care  should be taken to ensure the sum of the leakage currents of electrical equipment on the  load side of an RCD is significantly less than its rated residual current. RCDs may operate  at any value of residual current in excess of 50% of the rated residual current.  It is recommended the loading of the circuit should be such that the leakage current does  not exceed one th ird of the tripping current.  2 To avoid excessive leakage current causing unwanted tripping where socket-outlets are  protected by one RC D having a rated residual current not greater than 30 rnA,  consideration should be given to the number of socket-outlets protected and the nature of  electrical equipment likely to be connected to the socket-outlets.  3 Where RCDs are used, consideration should be given to the nature of the load, for  example, the supply waveform shape and the presence of high frequency and/or d.c.  components for the selection of the correct type of RCD.  In New Zealand the all RCDs shall be type A.  (g) Final sub-circuits supplying socket-outlets shall be provided with overcurrent  protection rated suitable for that final sub-circuit. An overcurrent protective device  may protect more than one socket-outlet.  NOTE: Consideration should be given to effects of unintended tripping, when an overcurrent  protective device protects multiple socket-outlets.  (h) The outgoing ACS unit is typically a mobile ACS.  K5 Interconnecting cables  KS.l General  The sub-mains (interconnecting cables) of an ACS system are construction wiring and the  requirements of Clause 2.5.3 for the provision of additional mechanical protection apply.  In addition, detachable sub-mains (interconnecting cables) of an ACS system shall also be  screened cables, with the screen being earthed.  NOTE: This provides protection against physical mechanical damage from sharp objects, or in the  case of the interconnecting cable being mechanically damaged by crushing or being cut, provides  additional protection by the automatic disconnection of the supply by operation of the protective  device protecting the cable.  KS.2 Connections  Direct or detachable connections may be used for sub-mains (interconnecting cables). See  Clause K2. I  K5.3 Detachable sub-main, plugs, cord connectors and appliance inlets  Detachable sub-main plugs, cord connectors and appliance inlets shall comply with  IEC 60309 or ASlNZS 3123 as agreed by the manufacturer and the user.  Devices for interconnection of sub-mains shall be rated at 32 A or above and be designed to  prevent inadvertent disconnection under load.  KS.4 Oistinction of sub-main sockets from other socket-outlets  The use of plug and soeket-outlet systems commonly used on the site to supply electrical  equipment shall not be used for the detachable connection of sub-mains.  KS.5 Overcurrent protection socket-outlets for detachable sub-mains  All socket-outlets used for the connection of detachable sub-mains shall be provided with  overcurrent protection rated at equal to or less than the rating of the socket-outlets.  COPYRIGHT  AS/NZS 3012:2010 58  KS.6 Labelling  Fixed socket-outlets or cord extension sockets used for interconnecting cabling systems  shall be identified as construction wiring and not suitable for electrical supply to hand held  tools. The ACS units shall be clearly marked with instructions to isolate the unit before  connection or disconnection of the sub-mains.  K6 INSTALLATION OF ACS ASSEMBLIES  K6.1 General  All ACS assemblies shall comply with Clause 2.3 and other relevant requirements.  Detachable interconnecting cables shall be earth screened or armoured cables.  K6.2 Openings  Openings in ACS assemblies for cable entries, cover plates, etc. shall be such that, when the  interconnecting cables, including their anchoring devices, are properly installed, the  protective measures against contact with live parts and stated degree of I P protection is  maintained.  K6.3 Interconnecting cables  Interconnecting cables shall be installed and protected to comply with Clause 2.5.  K6.4 Strain relief  Cables to and from ACS assemblies and connection facilities shall be suitably restrained to  prevent undue stress on the interconnecting cable connections (see Clause 2.3.5).  K7 INITIAL AND PERIODIC VERIFICATION  K7.1 initial verification  All ACS units and the detachable sub-main cabling systems, including fittings (if provided)  shall be inspected, tested and tagged prior to use as per Clause 3.  Following completion of the assembly of the ACS system, the requirements of Section 3 for  initial verification of construction wiring apply.  K7.2 Periodic verification  The requirements of Section 3 for periodic verification apply.
