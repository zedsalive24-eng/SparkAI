(Refer to Section 2.6).  When the installation does not meet the requirements of an unmetered supply (e.g. council public  parks) it will be treated as a metered installation.   In no case shall the maximum demand of these installations exceed the rating of a standard  overhead service (i.e. 100A per phase).  This arrangement generally applies only to Rate 3  Public Lighting where a standard charge per light applies. The customer and distributor must  also enter into a connection agreement.   Where the above has been satisfied, approval may be granted for the public body (or affiliated  operator) or other companies (approved by a public body) to install the consumer mains on poles  designated by the distributor.  Note: Specific requirements apply (particular pole types are unsuitable).  The customer  must contact the distributor for details and prior approval.

The electrical contractor is responsible for the supply and installation of the low voltage  support stand/terminal cover, flexible braid connectors, adaptor plates and consumer  mains, plus any equipment required by the distributor\u2019s Commercial and Industrial  Substation Manual.  (Refer to page 1 for details).   Consumer Mains Connection to LV Switchgear  Where consumer mains are to be connected at the LV terminals of the LV transformer  fuses or LV isolator in the LV compartment of a padmount transformer t he consumer  mains size shall be restricted to maintain clearances between phases when physically  connected. The standard striple fuse unit in a  padmount transformer permits a  maximum of 2*300mm2 aluminium or copper cables per phase. If you require a different  connection point  or consumer main s size, please seek advice from the distributor   before installing the consumer mains.   Multiple Transformers  Where multiple transformers supply a single switchboard, each transformer must be  connected to a separate bus section, however, a bus -tie switching arrangement is  permitted provided:  (a) The bus -tie switches are fitted with fail safe interlocking devices to prevent  paralleling of the supplies; and   (b) If the bus-tie switches are a type that cannot be operated under load, fitted with  a warning label to indicate the operating requirements; and  (c) Be installed and identified in accordance with AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules).  In general, where the distributor agrees to provide more than one connection point  to  an installation, the customer must ensure that the supplies cannot be connected in  parallel. Electronically controlled interlocking systems may be allowed (at the discretion  of the distributor) upon approval of a functional design and operational specification  certified by an RPEQ in the application stage.    Buried Earthing Systems  Provision of a high voltage substation requires the installation of buried earthing  systems.  These earthing systems are generally installed within 5m of the substation,  however in some cases additional earthing cables may be required.  These additional  earthing cables would generally be located under the line and may extend some  distance away from the substation.  For safety reasons, it is important that building  foundations, customers\u2019 low voltage earths or other metallic structures be located a  distance of at least 5m or more away from the high voltage earthing system.  The  distributor will provide advice on the location of the earthing system for specific  installations if required.    Joints in Consumer mains  Joints in un-metered consumer mains are permitted provided they comply with AS/NZS 3000  (Wiring Rules) and are not vulnerable to tampering by re-instating insulation to equivalent of   an unbroken cable.

Refer to Section 6.5.2, 6.6.2 and 6.12 for requirement details.    Multiple Tenancy Alterations  Where building alterations are being carried out and fall into m ajor category of works  as per Section 6.4.1 then all tenancies must be upgraded to comply with the  requirements of the QECM and QEMM including the requirement for isolation of the  building and each customer.  Where a single tenant of a multiple tenancy connection requires works that fall under  minor category of works (Section 6.4.2) or the addition of Small IES (Section 6.4.3) and  is unable to gain support from the body corporate to upgrade metering they may:  Install a second meter board directly next to existing non -compliant meter panel.  Alternatively, if the existing meter board is hinged with no asbestos, then they will be  able to use the existing meter position however will be required to install metering active  and neutral links.    Building Renovations / Alterations   Where building alterations or similar works are carried out to premises which results in  the metering equipment no longer being in  a position that is suitable to the metering  provider (refer to Section 6.9.9 for unsuitable locations), the customer  shall, at their  expense, relocate the metering equipment to an acceptable position complying with  Section 6.   Other Repairs & Damage caused outside a person\u2019s control (e.g.  Natural Disaster)  Compliance with Section 6 is required where the metering is located in an  unsuitable  location (refer to Section 6.9.9). In instances where the metering is not  located in an  unsuitable location, repairs may be carried out by \u201cusing methods that were acceptable  when that part of the electrical installation was originally installed\u201d, provided those  methods satisfy the fundamental safety principles of Part 1 of AS/NZS 3000.   Metering Isolation  To faci litate the requirements of the Electrical Safety Act 2002 (Qld) and Electrical Safety  Regulation 2013(Qld) for performing electrical work, and the Electricity Act 1994 (Qld) and  Queensland Electricity Connection Manual   Page 65 of 127 NA000403R509 Ver 3     Joint document between Energex and Ergon Energy    Energex Limited ABN 40 078 849 055   \uf06e   Ergon Energy Corporation Limited ABN 50 087 646 062  Electricity Regulation 2006 (Qld), supply to the revenue metering equipment for each customer  must be capable of being individually isolated.  All metering shall be connected with suitable active isolation devices connected to the line side  of the metering to allow safe access to the metering equipment. The requirement to install meter  isolator applies to all new installations including direct connected metering and current  transformer metering.

Metering Isolation Links/Circuit Breakers  Metering Isolation Links (MIL)/Circuit Breakers (CB) shall be installed in accordance with  the following:  (a) metering isolation links shall be clear cased type that comply with AS 60269,  sealable, back wired, fitted with a tubular link and installed on the line side of all direct  connected metering equipment; and  (b) all metering isolation links/CBs on a metering panel shall be connected in the same  line - load sequence; and  (c) the metering isolation links shall be mounted horizontally or vertically on the front of  the metering panel and if not obvious, clearly labelled to indicate the meter and portion  of the installation that they control. Clearance around the ends of metering isolation  links shall be 40mm; and   (d) the load through a MIL/CB shall not exceed 125A. In multiple supply applications (e.g.  general and controlled supplies ), where the load exceeds 125A, additional metering  isolation links/CBs shall be required. Where a fuse is used to replace the solid link (Refer  to Section 6.5.2.3) the maximum load through the metering isolation link shall not exceed  the rating of the fuse; and  (e) on multiple installations MIL/CB shall be provided for each network device  and  installed on or adjacent to the relevant meter/metering equipment; and  (f) for customers with three-phase supply the MIL/CB are to be grouped together and if  not obvious, permanent labelling must be applied to the meter panel to show the  meter(s) and installation that they control.  Aluminium cables are not suitable for connection directly into Meter ing Isolation Link  terminals unless fitted with a suitable means of termination, such as a soft -form bi- metallic sleeve or ferrule that is compatible with the Meter ing Isolation Link terminal  metal.  Where cables of these types are used as consumer mains, they shall comply with the  requirements of the electrical component/cable manufacturers and AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring  Rules), particularly in respect of termination and bending.

  "6.3": "6.3 and QECM 6.4).  2. Standard practice in multiple tenancy direct connected metering installations, where  the service fuse protection is greater than 80A, is to install an 80A fuse in the  metering isolation link in place of the solid link.  Where fuses are installed, the  metering provider will provide the fuse and place a label on the panel adjacent to the  metering isolation links stating: \u201cWARNING - The metering isolation links have been  fused for protection of metering provider Equipment\u201d.  3. Where the metering provider determines that the meter requires an 80A fuse for  adequate overload/fault protection, metering providers can install an 80A fuse in the  metering isolation link provided the Maximum Demand of the installation does not  exceed 80A. Should a 100A supply be required, the metering provider shall ensure  the meter used is suitably rated for, and protected by, the 80A service fuse. All other  requirements of Notes 1 and 2 above remain applicable.   Isolation of Current Transformer Metering  Current Transformer metering shall be capable of being individually isolated by a  suitable isolator or main switch. All isolation equipment shall be clearly identified and  readily accessible and shall be installed and maintained by the customer.  Where direct connected metering  is installed at the same switchboard as current  transformer metering, the direct connected metering is to comply with Section 6.5.2.",
  "6.5.3.1": "6.5.3.1 Specific Single Customer Current Transformer Metered Installations  Specific single customer current transformer metered installations include installations  where:  (i) Supply to the installation is interrupted for extended continuous periods of time  (>2 days) e.g. irrigation pumps, flood lifters, grain silos etc. (i.e. where the main  switch is used to control the installation and leave the electronic meter without  supply so that it cannot be read); or  (ii) \u201cSafety Services\u201d are installed and require supply to be maintained.

A lockable load-break isolator (with facility for locking off) that is capable of  isolating supply to the entire electrical installation is required.  Note: A charge will be made where the distributor  is required to isolate  supply.  (ii) Isolation of individual customers.  A lockable load-break isolator (with facility for locking off) shall be installed on  the line side of each set of revenue metering current transformers with the  customer\u2019s main switch(s) installed on the load side located on the same  switchboard as the CTs.  (Refer to Drawings QECM 6.3 and 6.4).   Metering Active and Metering Neutral Requirements   Metering Active Links  Where common consumer mains are installed for the purpose of supplying more than  one customer, metering active links shall be used.   Metering active links may be  required to facilitate the ease of connecting large cables to metering isolation links in  multi-tenancy installations or when there are more than two meters connected to single- phase.    Metering Neutral Links  The metering neutral shall be connected to a dedicated terminal of a metering neutral  link (MNL). All meter and network device neutral terminals shall be connected to a  dedicated terminal of the metering neutral link via a separate neutral conductor.  Soldered meter and network device neutral connections are not permitted.   Construction  Metering active and metering neutral links shall -  (a) incorporate a separate connecting device for the incoming and each outgoing  circuit; and  (b) consist of tunnel terminals  for termination of the conductors  using one of the  following methods (i); (ii) or (iii) for termination of the conductors.  i. Two screws shall be provided for each terminal; or  ii. One screw, the outside diameter of which is not less than 80% of the tunnel  diameter; or  iii. One screw, which is arranged so that the conductor is clamped by suitable  ferrules or plates in direct contact with the conductor.  (c) must be sealable or where this facility does not exist (for larger sized consumer  mains), the links must be installed within a suitable dedicated enclosure fitted with  a sealable cover.   Connection of Metering Neutral Conductors to Main Neutral  The neutral conductor of the consumer mains is not to be joined or looped through the  terminals of a revenue meter or metering neutral link. Metering neutral conductors shall  not be looped between metering equipment and when alterations or additions are  required on existing installations with neutral looping, the looping must be removed and  metering neutral link installed.   The metering neutral shall be connected to the main neutral in such a manner that it  cannot be disconnected or removed, for instance:  Queensland Electricity Connection Manual   Page 69 of 127 NA000403R509 Ver 3     Joint document between Energex and Ergon Energy    Energex Limited ABN 40 078 849 055   \uf06e   Ergon Energy Corporation Limited ABN 50 087 646 062  (a) soldered or crimped to the main neutral;  (b) a flag lug under the main neutral connection. Slotted lugs shall not be used;  (c) a sealable terminal or bolt on the neutral link/bar where -  (i) the consumer mains are a busway or busbar arrangement;  (ii) the installation main switchboard is supplied by more than one connection  point and a bus-tie arrangement is in place (the consumer mains neutrals shall  be connected to a common neutral link/bar);  (d) where the main neutral conductor is 25 mm2 or larger a sealable terminal may be  used;   (e) under a stud fitted with a suitable nut that is drilled and tapped into the consumer  mains neutral lug, provided the arrangement can be sealed.  Note: In domestic installations where parallel consumer mains are used the metering  neutral conductor shall be soldered to one conductor only.     Accessibility of Neutral Connections  The metering neutral connection is to be readily accessible and shall not be located  behind a panel where access requires isolation of supply.   On heavy current switchboards (refer to AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules)) the main neutral  and MEN connections to the busbar shall be located in an accessible position with a  minimum of 600mm clearance from exposed live parts.  If a minimum clearance of  600mm cannot be achieved, the use of a permanent barrier or location within a chamber  separate from that of the main switch or other exposed live parts is acceptable.    The arrangement must allow the main neutral  and MEN connections to be safely  accessed without isolating the supply to the switchboard or moving other cables.  (refer  to AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules)).  The use of shrouds over cable connections is not a sufficient barrier as the shrouds need  to be removed during polarity testing (unless access to conductors is provided via test  probe holes without the need to remove the shrouds).   Metering Active and Metering Neutral Link Mounting  Metering active and metering neutral links shall be mounted on the rear of the meter  panel or meter enclosure. Where metering active and neutral links are mounted on the  rear of the meter panel, they shall be mounted in such a way that they do not interfere  with the mounting of the metering equipment.  To not interfere with metering equipment (normally mounted on the upper or middle  section of the meter panel) it is preferable for the metering active and neutral links to be  mounted as close as practical to the bottom of the meter panel.  Where metering active and neutral links are mounted on the rear of the meter enclosure  and the material on which they are mounted is conductive, they shall be mounted on  insulating material with low water absorption properties that will extend past the live parts  of the link by a minimum of 25mm in all directions. This mounting arrangement is not  required where the link has been specifically designed and type tested for installation  onto metal surfaces.  Access to metering links must not be obstructed by any structure or wiring within the  switchboard.   Metering Active and Neutral Link Labelling  A permanent label is required on the front of the meter panel to indicate the location of  the metering active and metering neutral links.  Queensland Electricity Connection Manual   Page 70 of 127 NA000403R509 Ver 3     Joint document between Energex and Ergon Energy    Energex Limited ABN 40 078 849 055   \uf06e   Ergon Energy Corporation Limited ABN 50 087 646 062  Metering active and neutral links shall be identified as such and marked to identify  which meter is fed from each outgoing circuit of the metering link. Labelling must be  legible and durable in accordance with AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules).   Conductor Identification  To assist in identification of conductors and correct phase sequence of polyphase  meters, the individual conductors of consumer mains shall be clearly identified at both  ends (including up to each set  of Meter Isolation Links) by colour coding of the  conductor insulation (e.g. red, white and dark blue to identify active conductors). This  identification may be achieved by installation of 150mm minimum of colour coded  sleeving installed at the conductor terminations  (e.g. at the service pillar, mains  connection box, transformer terminals, switchboard/metering panel MIL etc). Insulation  tape is not an acceptable means of identification.   Metering and Control Equipment - Accommodation  The customer shall provide and maintain at their expense, suitable space, housing,  mounting and connecting facilities to accommodate meters and control equipment for  each supply arrangement (e.g. general and controlled supplies).  Unless otherwise specified and agreed with the distributor,  the minimum space  requirements for high voltage metering panels shall be as specified in Section 9.   Metering and Control Equipment - Position   General  Meters and control equipment shall be positioned so that they are not subjected to  mechanical damage, vibration, high temperature or other environmental situations that  might affect their correct operation (e.g. exposure to direct sunlight).  Where security of  a meter enclosure is necessary, a metering lock must be purchased to allow access.   (refer to Section 6.14).  The customer shall provide safe and ready access so that meters and control  equipment may be fixed, read, tested, adjusted and removed without difficulty at any  reasonable time but generally between the hours of 8.00am to 5.00pm Monday  to  Friday. The minimum access requirements for a meter enclosure shall be as per the  requirements for switchboards as detailed in AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules).  Unless otherwise approved by the distributor, or as varied by Section 6.9.4, all meters  and control equipment supplied for any one installation ( as defined in the National  Electricity Rules) shall be located in one readily accessible position, preferably on an  outside wall at the front of the building.   Current transformer meters should be installed  towards the front of the building on a  readily accessible outside wall.  Direct connected meters shall be positioned in  the same location as the Main switch  and MEN point to allow required testing to be undertaken by the distributor.  Note: Where a property or building is of a type that may be subdivided, the meters  and wiring should be located in an area that would be set aside as common property  or within each individual lot.   Residential Properties  On single or multiple residential premises a meter position suitable to the distributor  shall satisfy the following criteria:  (a) unless otherwise approved in writing by the distributor, meters shall be erected on  the side of the premises  facing a street from which there is pedestrian access or  within the first 2 m along an adjacent side of the premises.

(c) The panel within the meter enclosure should be not more than 300 mm from the  front of the meter enclosure.  (d) The meter panel is dedicated for revenue metering equipment and network  devices. Customer owned equipment (including GPOs, Contactors etc) shall not  be installed on the meter panel (this excludes metering isolation links/CBs as this  equipment is part of the revenue metering). Customer owned metering neutral  and active links should also be mounted on the rear of the meter panel or meter  enclosure and shall not be mounted on the front of the meter panel (refer to  Section 6.6.6).    Note: Where a larger panel is used, it is permissible for customer owned equipment to be  installed on the same panel outside of an area dedicated for use for metering  equipment provided the meter panel area meets the minimum size specified in  Queensland Electricity Connection Manual   Page 77 of 127 NA000403R509 Ver 3     Joint document between Energex and Ergon Energy    Energex Limited ABN 40 078 849 055   \uf06e   Ergon Energy Corporation Limited ABN 50 087 646 062  Appendix A, is indelibly marked with a demarcation line and is labelled to indicate  the meter panel section is dedicated for metering equipment      Meter panels on temporary builder\u2019s supplies do not need to be dedicated to revenue  metering equipment  unless they are intended to be installed in the permanent  position.   Metering and Control Equipment \u2013 Mounting Height  The top of any metering equipment shall have a maximum height of 2000mm above floor or  ground level.  The bottom of the meter, network device or item of metering equipment shall not  be less than 900 mm above floor or ground level when not installed in an enclosure or  dedicated switch room or meter room.   This height may be reduced to 700mm (500mm for  metering isolation links) above floor or ground level when installed within an enclosure or  dedicated switch room or meter room.  For clearances in front of the metering enclosure doors refer to AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules)  (i.e. minimum clearances of 600mm).    Use of Platforms  Where the customer is required to provide a platform to access a meter installation, it shall be  designed to AS 1657 (Fixed Platforms, Walkways, Stairways and Ladders) , be certified by a  RPEQ that the structure is suitable for the application and be designed to support a minimum  load of 200kg.  A certificate of approval shall be submitted to the distributor prior to connection  of supply.    Where meters and switchboards are installed on service poles, the platform shall be self - supporting and permanently mounted.    The service pole shall not be used to support any platform structure, and any step-type ladder  access shall be clear of any fences or sharp objects that may be considered a fall hazard.   For clearances in front of the metering enclosure doors refer to AS/NZS 3000 (Wi ring Rules)  (i.e. minimum clearances of 600mm).   For existing installations where access is considered unsafe, the metering provider may refuse  to read the meters until the unsafe condition has been rectified by the customer or may repair  the access at the customer\u2019s cost.  (Electricity Regulation 2006(Qld)).    Metering Locks  Where the distributor agrees to meters being erected in an enclosure within an area which may  be locked for security reasons, or where meters may be subject to vandalism, the distributor\u2019s  metering lock must be purchased and installed to permit access.  (R efer to page 1 for  purchasing details and Drawing QECM 6.7 for lock types). The installation of \u201cPrivate Locks\u201d is  not permitted for providing access to metering equipment.   Where the distributor\u2019s metering lock is installed, all tenants who require access to the meter  panel shall be provided with such access.    Note: If the distributor\u2019s personnel are requested to open the metering lock for tenant access,  the customer will be charged a call out fee.   Metering locks shall not be used on a garage door, verandah door or similar doors that provide  access to private areas. (Refer to Section 6.9.9 and Drawing QECM 6.7).  The distributor may provide master metering lock keys to metering providers when requested  in accordance with their procedures. Metering providers  will keep master keys secure and  return them to the distributor when no longer required or when requested by the distributor.   Current Transformer Metering \u2013 Housing  (a) Each set of current transformers and meter voltage fuses are required to be  mounted in a separate dedicated metering chamber. This chamber is to enclose  only the metering provider\u2019s equipment.   Queensland Electricity Connection Manual   Page 78 of 127 NA000403R509 Ver 3     Joint document between Energex and Ergon Energy    Energex Limited ABN 40 078 849 055   \uf06e   Ergon Energy Corporation Limited ABN 50 087 646 062  (b) To allow commissioning and testing of current transformer metering installations to  be performed safely, all live low voltage parts within current transformer chambers  are to be individually insulated (insulation must completely cover all live parts).  Heat shrink insulation is acceptable for insulating busbars.  All bolted busbar or  cable connections are to be covered with non-adhesive insulation secured in place  by cable ties.  A non- conductive insulated barrier alone (removable cover over CT chamber) is not an  acceptable method of insulation.     Current Transformer Metering Installations  The distributor requires all LV current transformer metering installation designs to have prior  approval for the metering arrangement. Please submit form LV CT Advice Form available from  the distributor\u2019s website, see page 1 for details. This form requires the submission of  Switchboard Layout and Single Line Diagra ms as early as possible to allow design  modifications to be carried out if necessary, prior to switchboards being built.    If this information is not provided the distributor  cannot guarantee supply will be connected if  the switchboard does not comply.    Early submission of drawings will assist in reducing the time and costs for all parties and avoid  late modifications of current transformer metering switchboards.

Where there are multiple EG systems  connected at a premise through a connection point, the system capacity is the aggregate of all  generation (unless agreed otherwise with the distributor and documented in a connection  agreement). .    Explanation of Metering Schemes Available  Two metering schemes are available for the grid- connected Embedded Generating (EG)  systems, known as the \u201c Net Energy \u201d and the \u201c Gross Energy\u201d schemes . All EG systems   installations must be compliant with the distributor\u2019s connection standards.  The Queensland Government Solar Bonus Scheme or Regional Feed- in Tariff requires the  installation of a Net Energy metering solution.  The Net Energy metering scheme has a single import/export meter installed in the place of the  existing general supply energy consumption meter(s).  The Gross Energy metering scheme may require an additional import / export meter installed  on the meter panel to record the EG system supply energy generation only.   Agreements  All customers with an EG system must have a Connection Agreement for the EG system in place  with the distributor before the EG system can be connected to the distributor\u2019s supply network.   This includes systems that are configured as  minimal-export or  non-export back to the  distribution network.  The customer or their agent shall nominate the metering scheme on the application form for  network connection of an EG system, and the electrical contractor shall nominate the metering  scheme on their Electrical Work Request sent to the distributor.  Customers wishing to be compensated for any electricity exported by the EG system to the  distributor\u2019s supply network other than through the Queensland Government Solar Bonus  Scheme must also have a Power Purchase Agreement in place with their retailer.  Details on  how feed-in tariffs works and determining eligibility for the retention of Queensland Government  Solar Bonus Scheme can be found at the Queensland Government website  https://www.qld.gov.au/housing/buying-owning-home/feed-in-tariffs.   Approval of Equipment  Typical direct connected metering arrangements have been developed in line with EG system  requirements and retailer offered supply types however it is up to the meteri ng provider to  install suitable metering arrangement to meet site requirements   Notes:  1. Exceptions to the above standards may be approved upon receipt of a written application  in exceptional circumstances.  Applications shall be made in writing to the di stributor.   Standard charges will apply for such arrangements.  2. It must be noted that the \u201c Gross Scheme\u201d may require an additional meter, and the end  user must be made aware that provision of this space is required at the current metering  location.  3. In a \u201cNet Scheme\u201d, if the principal metering has more than one phase, it is a requirement  that a polyphase meter must be used.

A.2.2.2 The enclosure, if of steel construction, shall  be of galvanised or  zincalume material and shall comply with the requirements of AS 1397  \u201cSteel sheet and strip - hot dip zinc-coated or aluminium/zinc-coated\u201d.  A galvanised steel meter enclosure shall have all galvanised surfaces  repaired with a suitable zinc rich coating.  All exterior surfaces of the  enclosure should be painted with one coat of \u201cetch primer\u201d.  A.2.2.3 The use of aluminium shall be restricted to corrosion resistant alloys as  recommended for the exposure to be encountered in service (stainless  steel is an acceptable alternative).  A.2.2.4 Rivets shall be of a material that is compatible with the case material  and must not react to set up points of corrosion.  A.2.2.5 Where additional mechanical strength is required stiffening ribs may be  utilised.  Such ribs must not in any way reduce the minimum internal  dimensions.  A.2.3 Door  A.2.3.1 The meter enclosure is to be fitted with a hinged door of sufficient  strength to prevent buckling or warping.  A.2.3.2 The door shall be  side hinged, unless otherwise approved by the  metering provider, and fitted with a suitable non- corroding chain or  other approved means to limit the door travel to approximately 100  degrees.  The door may be hinged at either the left or right side of the  meter enclosure and shall be fitted with a simple self-latching device.   A.2.3.3 Hinges provided shall be of non-corroding material and so designed or  fitted with non-corroding pins as to prevent seizing.  A.2.4 Door Latch  The latching device provided shall engage automatically and hold the door firmly closed.  A.2.5 Entry of Wiring  Adequate provisions shall be made for knockouts or slots for the entry of wiring to the  meter enclosure.  (Refer to AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules) for fire protection requirements).  Entries may be provided in the top of the enclosure but in this case the final assembly  should withstand the test in Item A.2.7 of Appendix A.  A.2.6 Earthing  To ensure an effective Earth of the Switchboard Surround an earthing stud or terminal  complying with the requirements of AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules) shall be provided for the  connection of an earthing conductor within the enclosure.  The stud or terminal shall not  obstruct equipment within the enclosure.  A.2.7 Weatherproofing  The enclosure is to comply with AS/NZS 60529 \"Degrees of Protection Provided by  Enclosures\" to a minimum of IP23.  The enclosure shall provide adequate ventilation to minimise condensation and be capable  of draining any moisture that may collect within the enclosure.
