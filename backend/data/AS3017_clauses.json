  "1.1": "1.1   SCOPE   This Standard sets out some of the common inspection and test methods required to verify that a low  voltage, multiple earthed neutral (MEN) (TN-C-S) electrical installation complies with safety  requirements for the prevention of fire, or a person or livestock from sustaining an electric shock.   The tests detailed in this Standard are as follows:   (a) Earthing system continuity and resistance;  (b) Insulation resistance;  (c) Polarity;  (d) Correct circuit connections;  (e) Phase sequence;  (f) Fault-loop impedance;  (g) Verification of operation of residual current devices;  (h) Earth electrode resistance;  (i) Touch voltage; and  (j) Continuity and resistance of the incoming neutral.  The Standard illustrates testing procedures for an electrical installation connected to an MEN system  of earthing. The equipment and methods:  (k) Are not exclusive and other equipment and methods may be used;  (l) May be applied to types of low voltage installations other than MEN; and   (m) May be applied to work affecting only part of an installation, e.g. alterations, additions or repairs.",
  "1.2": "1.2   SAFETY   To comply with the requirements of AS/NZS 3000, all electrical installations and any alterations,  additions and repairs to electrical installations shall, prior to being placed in service or use, be:  (a) Inspected as far as is practicable; and   (b) Tested.   Electrical testing inherently involves some degree of hazard. It is the responsibility of the person  performing the tests to ensure that safe practices are used in the performance of test procedures.   In this Standard tests are described both for situations where the supply is connected and where it is  not connected. Preference has been given to tests where the supply is not connected as this would  minimize the shock risk. However, testing with the supply connected may also be conducted and  some alternative test methods have been included. In these situations greater care must be exercised  to avoid direct or indirect contact with live parts or the energizing of exposed conductive parts.   Whether testing with supply disconnected or connected, the following precautions should be followed:   (c) Treat equipment, such as cables and terminations, as being energized until proven otherwise;   Master Electricians Australia- Reproduced under copyright Licence number 1602-c100-8  6 AS/NZS 3017:2007     COPYRIGHT  (d) Follow safe working practices as outlined in AS/NZS 4836;  (e) Understand the correct use of the equipment to be used and its rating; and  (f) Check that the equipment being used, including any test leads, probes or clips:  (i) Is suitable for the voltage being tested  (ii) Is in good working order; and   (iii) Has no damaged parts with which contact could be dangerous.     NOTE \u2014 For the testing of individual circuits when the circuit protective device has been removed or switched off,  a no-voltage test should be conducted at the end of the circuit to ensure the correct circuit protective device has  been removed or switched off.",

The resistance of protective earthing conductors shall be low enough to permit the passage of current  necessary to operate the circuit protective device. This condition is satisfied when the fault-loop  impedance is low enough to allow sufficient current to flow in the earth fault-loop to cause the  protective device to operate within a specified disconnection time.   NOTE \u2014   (1) As described in 3.6, the maximum allowable resistance of the protective earthing conductor associated  with any particular circuit depends on the type and rating of the protective device and the impedance of the  live conductors that comprise the circuit in which the fault occurs.

If this is expected to occur, testing at the termination should be carried  out at the time of initial connection or other convenient time when the termination is still  accessible. Where this is not practicable, the inaccessible connection may be proven by testing  at a more convenient point on the parts which are to be earthed or bonded by the conductor;  and  (b) If the insulation resistance test, in accordance with 3.2, is not satisfactory (e.g. a value of less  than 1 M\u2126 is obtained) earth continuity and resistance tests may need to be repeated after any  fault is rectified.  NOTE \u2014 Where there is a possibility of a parallel connection between a protective earthing conductor and other  conductive parts, e.g. a water heater, the protective earthing conductor should be disconnected from the electrical  device and tested independently.

These tests are to be carried out with the neutral conductor disconnected from the MEN system.   Where surge protective devices (SPDs) or other equipment are likely to influence the test or be  damaged, such equipment shall be disconnected before carrying out the insulation resistance  test. Where it is not reasonably practical to disconnect such equipment (e.g. in the case of fixed  socket-outlets incorporating an SPD) the test voltage of the particular circuit may be reduced to  250 V d.c., but the insulation resistance should have a value of at least 1 M\u2126;  (f) Where an earth sheath return (ESR) system is used, the neutral conductor is not to be  connected to any active conductor for the purpose of the insulation resistance test; and  (g) All switch positions/combinations need to be tested in two-way and intermediate applications  and on the load side of devices such as contactors.

  "3.4.3": "3.4.3   Test procedures   Testing should confirm that any resistance measured between the active and neutral conductors of a  circuit is consistent with the load. For example, on a socket-outlet circuit with no connected equipment  a high resistance (approximately infinity) should be expected; whereas on a 230 V, 4.8 kW water  heater circuit, a resistance of about 11 \u2126 should be expected.   The tests illustrated in figures 3.15, 3.16, 3.17, 3.18 and 3.19 show recommended methods of testing  for correct circuit connections which require the use of an ohmmeter. Some tests require the use of  resistors of known values.   Other methods may be applied, for example:  (a) An interconnected neutral can be detected by removing the circuit neutral at the switchboard  and proving that no connection to neutral exists at the equipment;  (b) Using a clip-on ammeter over the energized circuit conductors to verify that with all circuit  equipment operating, the equivalent active load current is also passing through the correct  circuit neutral; or   (c) With only one circuit energized and equipment operational, an incorrect or interconnected active  can be detected by using a voltage indicator to confirm that the load side of protective devices  on other circuits are not energized from the circuit under test.",

NOTE \u2014  (1) The MEN system has a multiplicity of neutral earthing electrodes and an earth electrode at each  installation. The distribution neutral earth electrodes give the system ground resistance.  (2) The installation earth electrode is connected to the installation exposed conductive parts. Exposed  conductive parts are in contact, via bonding or fortuitously, with other grounded parts such as water pipes.  Bonding minimises the touch voltage between exposed conductive parts of the installation and grounded  conductive parts.  (3) The installation MEN connection connects the earth electrode to the supply neutral. As the supply neutral  also acts as a return path for earth fault currents it is a Protective Earth and Neutral (PEN).   (4) This system of bonding and earthing should minimise the touch voltage from the exposed conductive parts  to ground during normal operation. However, if the supply neutral (PEN) is disconnected the path through  the ground is the only path. The touch voltage to ground is then dependent on the resistance of the paths  to ground in series with the load resistance and the current flowing.  (5) Similarly, if the supply neutral (PEN) is high resistance, the touch voltage depends on the ground paths in  parallel with the neutral (PEN). On single phase installations this current is the same as the active current;  on three phase installations the neutral current is the vector sum of the active currents.  (6) During a fault the fault current should return to the transformer via the neutral (PEN) and operate the  overcurrent or RCD protection. If the neutral is open circuit or high resistance, the voltages to neutral will  be unbalanced and a voltage will exist from neutral (PEN) to the exposed conductive parts and ground,  and current may flow in water pipes and voltages may exist across disconnected pipes. In the event of an  open or high resistance neutral, a single earth electrode cannot be relied upon to provide a low resistance  path sufficient to operate the protective devices",

  "3.10.2.1": "3.10.2.1 Test using an earth fault-loop impedance meter  The incoming neutral can be tested by using a proprietary earth fault-loop impedance tester as  follows:  (a) Turn all main switches OFF;  (b) To remove all alternate current paths, for example, water pipe bond, remove MEN connection  and incoming neutral from the neutral bar at the main switchboard; and  (c) Measure between the incoming active(s) on line side of main switch and incoming neutral.  NOTE \u2014  (1) In multi-phase installations, the readings should be substantially the same.  (2) Expert advice is required to reconnect earth fault-loop testers for active to neutral tests instead of active to  earth tests.  (3) If the earth fault-loop impedance is greater than 0.5 \u2126 consult the electricity network provider.",
  "3.10.2.2": "3.10.2.2 Test using a clamp type ammeter  The condition of the supply neutral may be assessed by measuring the current in the consumers  mains active(s) and neutral conductors, the main earthing conductor and the MEN connection. With a  substantial load such as an electric range or water heater applied, use a clamp ammeter to measure  the current flow in the active and neutral conductors separately, upstream of the MEN connection, and  in the MEN connection. For multiphase installations, place the clamp meter around all active  conductors simultaneously, ensuring the line and load of each phase conductor is orientated the same  way.  NOTE \u2014   (1) The current flowing in the active conductor(s) and the neutral conductor should be substantially the same.  (2) If a large proportion of the active current is flowing in the main earthing conductor and MEN connection,  there is the possibility of a continuity problem with the consumer mains/service neutral connections for that  installation.  (3) If the sum of the currents in the main neutral conductor and MEN connection exceeds that in the active  conductor(s), there is a possibility of a continuity problem with another installation further from the  distribution transformer than the installation under test. This can be confirmed by checking for current in  the main neutral conductor and the MEN connection with the main switch(es) off.  (4) This test requires a competent person trained in this testing technique.",

These standards are  developed through an open process of consultation and consensus, in which all interested parties are  invited to participate. Through a Memorandum of Understanding with the Commonwealth  government, Standards Australia is recognized as Australia\u2019s peak national standards body.  Standards New Zealand  The first national Standards organization was created in New Zealand in 1932. The Standards  Council of New Zealand is the national authority responsible for the production of Standards.  Standards New Zealand is the trading arm of the Standards Council established under the Standards  Act 1988.  Australian/New Zealand Standards  Under a Memorandum of Understanding between Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand,  Australian/New Zealand Standards are prepared by committees of experts from industry,  governments, consumers and other sectors. The requirements or recommendations contained  in published Standards are a consensus of the views of representative interests and also take  account of comments received from other sources. They reflect the latest scientific and industry  experience. Australian/New Zealand Standards are kept under continuous review after publication  and are updated regularly to take account of changing technology.  International Involvement  Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand are responsible for ensuring that the Australian  and New Zealand viewpoints are considered in the formulation of international Standards and that  the latest international experience is incorporated in national and Joint Standards. This role is vital  in assisting local industry to compete in international markets. Both organizations are the national  members of ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International  Electrotechnical Commission).
