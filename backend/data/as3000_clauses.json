Primary protection for telecommunication lines is provided by a  gas  discharge tube type SPD. At domestic premises, this is preferably installed  in a wall box near the electrical switchboard and connected to the main  earth bar. Figure F4 shows this c onnection in the protector hou sing.  AS/NZS 3000:2018  526    COPYRIGHT  A special need exists for earthing of conductive telecommunicat ions  equipment. Current standards requi re a hard-wired earth for som e  equipment. There is a range of services which need to be bonded  to the  main earth bar via the telecomm unications earth, e.g. telecommu nications  SPDs and cable screens, antennas, CATV, etc.  Some electrical installation practices make access to the earth  electrode  and earthing conductor difficult. To achieve the necessary shor t  telecommunication bonding conductor, a bonding bar or terminal external to  the main switchboard and mounted outside the meter box or elect rical  switchboard on an outside wall is recommended for domestic inst allations.  It will assist telecommunications carriers if  the bonding bar or terminal is  provided when the swit chboard is installed.  This method is detail ed in AS/CA S009 and is  shown below in Fig ure F4.

The \u2018IP\u2019 rating is usually written as \u2018IP\u2019 followed by two numb ers and,  sometimes, an additional letter.  The first number, from 1 to 6, designates a degree of \u2018protecti on against  solid objects\u2019, and \u2018protection of persons against access to ha zardous  parts\u2019.  The second number, from 1 to 8, designates a degree of \u2018protect ion against  entry of water with harmful effects\u2019.  If a specific degree of protection is not designated, an \u2018X\u2019 is  used instead of  either one or both numbers.  The additional letter, from A to D, when used, designates a deg ree of  \u2018protection of persons agains t access to hazardous parts\u2019.  AS/NZS 60947.3:2015, Anne x D, refers to an IP56NW rating for sw itch  disconnectors within enclosures;  this is required in AS/NZS 503 3 PV  Installations. \u2018NW\u2019 is in refer ence to no water entry into the enclosure. The  test procedure is identical to that undertaken to verify the IP x6 rating but no  water is to enter the enclosure during the test.  On infrequent occasions, a supplementary letter, H, M, S or W, is used to  designate special classes of electrical equipment.

The information in the tables in this Appendix only applies to aerial  conductor sizes up to 2 \uf0b4 4 core 95 mm 2 aluminium (Al) and 4 \uf0b4 7/3.5 mm 2  copper (Cu) with a maximum to tal weight of 2.7 kg/m.  NOTE: AS/NZS 7000 and its companion HB 331 can be used to deter mine  support structures for conductor sizes and installation conditi ons not covered by  these tables.  The following types of conductor support structures are covered  b y  t h i s   Appendix:  (a) Timber posts and poles.  (b) Square timber struts.  (c) Angle iron struts.  (d) Steel poles.  (e) Steel square section.  (f) Fabricated steel poles.  D1.2   Using the tables in this Appendix  Table D2 gives the forces exer ted by the aerial conductor line.  T h i s  i s  a   function of\u2014  (a) the type of conductor being used;  (b) the span length bet ween supports; and  (c) the design sag.  These factors combine to give the normal tension of an aerial c onductor, in  kilonewtons (kN). The last colum n of Table D2 indicates the min imum pole  or strut strength needed (S rating)  to support the normal load applied by  that tension.  Using this strength rating refer to Tables D3 to D13 to select the  corresponding size of post, pole or strut. The S rating selecte d from  Tables D3 to D13 has to be equal to or greater than the S ratin g derived  from Table D2.   AS/NZS 3000:2018  492    COPYRIGHT  NOTES:   1 The free length to lowest conductor support shown in the tabl es is the  distance between the lowest conductor support and\u2014  (a) the ground for a pole or post; or  (b) the closest fixing bolt on a structure for a strut.  2 Galvanized steel-pipe posts with outside diameters up to and including  165 mm are Grade 250 steel water pipe commercially available in  6.5 m  lengths. Posts specified with diameters of 168 mm have to be Gr ade 350  structural steel circular hollow sections, which may need to be  specially  ordered. Steel-pipe posts with a structural grade greater than 250 need to be  clearly marked with their tested strength grade.  D2   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR POSTS AND POLES  D2.1   Sinking of posts/poles in ground  Posts/poles need to be secu rely set in the ground.  If the soil does not provide enough support, e.g. in built-up g round or soft  soil, secure posts/poles either by setting them at a greater de pth than  normally necessary, or by using bearing blocks or shoes. Refer to Table D1  and the notes below.  Where, because of unusual circumstances, the butt of the post/p ole cannot  be sunk to the necessary depth in the ground, an alternative co nstruction,  such as flange mounting on a reinforced concrete structure, may  be used.  In such cases, the expertise of a structural engineer is needed  to ensure  that the mounting is suitabl e for the installation.  The length of the post/pole above ground needs to be assessed w hen  selecting post/pole sizes to obtain necessary clearances.  NOTES:   1 The free length to the lowest conductor support shown in Tabl e D1 is the  distance between the lowest conductor support and ground level.   2 Soil quality   Soil quality is defined according to AS/NZS 7000:  (a) Poor   Soft clay, poorly compacted sand and soils that tend to abso rb  large amounts of water (150 kPa/m).  (b) Medium    Compact medium clay, well-bonded sandy loam, bonded  sand and gravel with reasonable surface water drainage (300 kPa /m).  (c) Good   Well compacted rock soil, hard clay and well-bonded sand and   gravel with good surface water drainage (600 kPa/m).  3 Posts/poles set in concrete    Where a post/pole is set in concrete, it needs to  be located centrally in a hole with a size corresponding to a m inimum  diameter of 100 mm greater than the diameter of the post/pole.  The concrete should be finished as follows:  (a) For a wooden post/pole\u2014not less than 250 mm below ground le vel.  (b) For a steel post/pole\u2014100 mm above ground level and shaped to shed  water.    493 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  Setting the post/pole in concrete is equivalent to improving th e soil quality by  one step, i.e. from \u2018poor\u2019 to \u2018medium\u2019 or from \u2018medium\u2019 to \u2018goo d\u2019. This  corresponds to a reduction in the necessary sinking depth of th e pole.  The post/pole should be left undisturbed for three days, or lon g enough to  ensure that the concrete has developed adequate strength prior to attaching  the aerial line.  4 Posts/poles set in solid rock    Where a post/pole is set in solid rock, the  depth in ground may be reduced by 0.3 m.  D2.2   Timber posts/poles  Timber posts and poles need to be of untreated hardwood or timb er with  preservative treatment in accordance with AS 3818.11.  Tables D3 to D6 set out the minimum sizes of timber posts or po les of  untreated hardwood tim ber with durability of Class 1 and 2 and strength  rating of S3 or better.  The base of timber posts/poles  and surrounding ground needs to be treated  against insect and fungal attack by  environmentally approved me thods.  Timber posts/poles need to be c apped at the top to prevent wate r  penetration.  The distance between the top anchor bolt and the top of the pos t/pole  should not be less than 200 mm.  D2.3   Steel-pipe posts/poles  The necessary sizes/grades of steel-pipe posts/poles are set ou t in  Tables D7 to D13, with Figure D1  showing how the tables are app lied.

In some cases internal sea ling should be  provided.  3 An opening with less than 5 mm diameter of free space is cons idered to be a  close fit. Therefore, any opening of 5 mm diameter or greater r equires  sealing with a fire-retardant sealant.  4 Wiring enclosures, such as conduits, having an internal free space of greater  than 5 mm diameter also require sealing to stop any draft effec t that could  allow the spread of fire.    149 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  SECTION 3   SELECTION AND  INSTALLATION OF WIRING SYSTEMS",

Thus, reference to nati onal  construction codes is recommended for clarification of the appl ication and  any exceptions. National construction codes also contain a numb er of other  provisions which relate to the design, selection and installati on of  equipment that forms part of an electrical installation, and wh ich are  intended to satisfy objectives for safety, health, amenity, sus tainability and  energy efficiency.  This Appendix outlines the above provisions in order to inform the electrical  industry and practitioners who wo rk with AS/NZS 3000 of measure s  affecting electrical installati ons implemented under the Nation al  Construction Code (NCC), for Australia, and the New Zealand Bui lding  Code (NZBC).  E2   AUSTRALIA  E2.1   General  The NCC is written by the Austra lian Building Codes Board in co njunction  with the building and plumbing authorities of the States and Te rritories. Its  goals are nationally consistent health, safety, amenity and sus tainability in  building construction and plumbing and drainage.  The NCC is adopted under building a nd plumbing construction leg islation in  Australian States and Territories , which have responsibility fo r building  construction and plumbing and drainage installations. The NCC i s  implemented through building certif iers, both local government and private,  and other professional practitioners.  The NCC is in three volumes:  (a) Volume One\u2014 Building Code of Australia  Class 2 to Class 9 Buildings   (for multi-residential, commercia l, industrial an d public build ings and  structures).  (b) Volume Two\u2014 Building Code of Austra lia Class 1 and Class 10  Buildings  (for houses and associated structures).  (c) Volume Three\u2014 Plumbing Code of Australia  (for plumbing and  drainage associated with all classes of buildings).

SPDs do not provide protection against prolonged overvoltage or  p o w e r   outages and brownouts.  One or more of the following c onditions could warrant the insta llation of  SPDs in areas:  (a) Where lightning is prevalent.  (b) Where power disturbances are frequent, for example, in indu strial  areas.  (c) Where the site is at the end of long overhead powerlines.  (d) Where the site is expos ed, for example, on a hill.  (e) Where sites may be many hundreds of metres apart, for examp le, in  outer suburban or rural areas.  (f) Where the site contains sensitive electronic equipment, for  example, a  home office, home theatre , computer network, etc.  AS/NZS 1768 provides a  detailed risk assessment on the need for  lightning  and surge protection. The result of a risk assessment will dete rmine the  need for both structural and surge protection. If structural pr otection is  installed, primary surge prot ection, at least, is also required .  This Appendix does not  consider surge protective components tha t may be  incorporated into appliances connected to the electrical instal lation. The  presence of such components may modify the behaviour of the mai n SPD  of the electrical installati on and may need additional coordina tion.  F1.2  Selection and installation of SPDs  F1.2.1    Location  Primary SPDs are installed near t he origin of the electrical in stallation or at  the main switchboard.   AS/NZS 3000:2018  522    COPYRIGHT  Secondary SPDs are installed at  switchboards remote from the ma in  switchboard. Secondary SPDs shoul d be coordinated with the prim ary  SPDs in accordance with the m anufacturer\u2019s instructions.  Where premises contain sensit ive electronic equipment, addition al  protection at the equipmen t may also be warranted.  Telecommunications, remote tele metry and industrial process con trol sites  require special attention. AS/ NZS 1768 provides further informa tion.  F1.2.2    Installation   SPDs should be\u2014  (a) installed after the main switch but prior to any RCD device s. Where  the main switch is an RCD , refer to Paragraph F2.4;  (b) protected by an appropriate  fuse or circuit-breaker separat e from the  SPD;  (c) connected at the main swit chboard between phase and neutral ;  NOTE: Figure F1 shows a typical connection of a primary SPD for  a    single-phase installation.  (d) connected at switchboards rem ote from the main switchboard and  without MEN connection, from eac h phase to neutral and from neu tral  to earth;  NOTE: Figure F2 shows a typical installation of a secondary SPD  f o r  a   single-phase installation.

AS/NZS 1768 provides fur ther details on the selection of primar y and  secondary SPDs.    523 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  Neutral bar Loads Supply Earth bar Earth electrode Main switch Fuse CB SPD MEN connection RCD   FIGURE  F1   TYPICAL PRIMARY SPD AT MAIN SWITCHBOARD  Neutral bar Loads Earth bar Main switch CBCB Fuse SPD From MEN connection RCD   NOTE:  This configuration, with an integrated gas discharge tub e connected from neutral to  earth, is most commonly used and provides protection for all modes of disturbance.  FIGURE  F2   TYPICAL SECONDARY SPD AT DISTRIBUTION BOARD   AS/NZS 3000:2018  524    COPYRIGHT  F1.2.3    Selection of surge protection devices (SPDs)  For most domestic supplies in urban environments, a surge ratin g of  Imax = 40 kA per phase for an 8/20 \uf06ds  i m p u l s e  a n d  a  m a x i m u m  w o r k i n g   voltage of 275 V a.c. to 320 V a.c. is suitable.  In the case of installations in exposed locations in high light ning areas, with  long overhead service lines, or industrial and commercial premi ses, it may  be prudent to install SPDs with a higher surge rating (typicall y 100 kA per  phase for an 8/20 \uf06ds impulse).  F1.2.4   Overcurrent protective devices   SPDs should be protected against short-circuit by suitable over current  protective devices. In accordance with Clause 2.5.2, the short- circuit  withstand of the SPD, t ogether with the overcurrent protective device,  should be not less than the pros pective short-circuit current a t the point of  installation.  The current rating of the SPD ove rcurrent protective device sho uld be\u2014  (a) as recommended by the SPD manufacturer but not greater than  t h e   manufacturer\u2019s declared maxi mum backup fuse rating; and  (b) less than the rating of the im mediate upstream protective d evice.  NOTE: Notwithstanding the above, the following current ratings of HRC fuses or  circuit-breakers are suitable for typical domestic applications , such as  households:  (a)  32 A for a 40 kA SPD.  or  (b)  63 A for a 100 kA SPD.  If an SPD is installed on the load side of an RCD, the RCD shou ld have a  breaking capacity of not less t han 3 kA. S-type RCDs, in accord ance with  AS/NZS 61008.1 and AS/ NZS 61009.1 are deemed to satisfy this  recommendation.  F1.2.5    Connecting conductors  Conductors used to connect an SPD to both the line, via the ove rcurrent  protective device, and to the main earthing or neutral conducto r should be  consistent with the current rat ing of the backup fuse or circui t-breaker but  should be not less than 6 mm 2, be as short and direct as possible and with  no loops.  The total conductor length between the two points of connection  including  both active and earth/neutral should be less than 1 m (ideally   300 mm\u2013600 mm) overall.  A connection to the neutral conductor should be as close as pra cticable to  the MEN link.    525 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  F2   SURGE PROTECTIVE EARTHING AND BONDING  Where conductive telecommunications conductors and equipment ar e  employed, overvoltage protection may be required at buildings to prevent  injury to people and to prevent damage to equipment. An example  of how  an injury can occur is show n in Figure F3 below.  Electrical Switchboard I Distant earth (zero volts) EVE Telecommunications service Earth electrode V   FIGURE  F3   EXAMPLE OF HOW A TRANSIENT DEVELOPS  A HAZARDOUS VOLTAGE DIFFERENCE IN A BUILDING  A transient overvoltage on the pow erline may result in a high surge current  to earth via the MEN link in the electrical switchboard. This m omentarily  raises the local earth potential typically by tens of thousands  of volts. Thus,  any object connected to the local earth, e.g. earthed electrical appliances,  such as the refrigerator shown,  metallic plumbing, concrete flo or slab, etc.,  will momentarily be ra ised in potential.

While this Standard does not prescribe the installation  of socket-outlets and lighting points on these circuits, the physical limitations of the terminals of these devices may make their connection impractical.  3 For the purposes of determining the number of points, a multi ple combination o f socket-outlets is regarded as t he same number of points as the number of integral socket-outlets in the combination.  4 A hotplate and oven are considered to be one cooking appliance i f mounted within one room.  5 Maximum demand is limited by the circuit-breaker on the final  subcircuit, which allows for diversity in operati on of the range elements and hot plates.  6 Lighting points    A luminaire is deemed to comprise one or more lighting points, according to the number of points at which it is connected by f lexible cords to the installation wiring, or according to the number of sections in which it is switched or controlled. Connections of festoon lighting and decorative ligh ting are not regarded as lighting points. See Table C1  for track systems and ELV ligh ting.   A socket-outlet installed more than 2.3 m above a floor for th e connection of a luminaire may be included as a lighting point.  An appliance rated at not more than 150 W, which is permanently  connected, or connected by means of a socket-outlet installed more than 2.3 m  above a floor, may be included as a lighting point.  7 Applies to circuits with 10 A socket-outlets connected where there are two or more circuits in an electrical installation.   8 Restricted connections    Table C9 precludes the connection of any socket-outlets on conductors having a cross-sectional area less than 2.5 mm 2, except where they are used for the connection of a lighting point, or appliance rated  at not more than 150 W and installed more than 2.3 m above a floor [see Note 6 above].   9 The values are intended to be utilized when the final subcirc uit is provided for general use. Where it is known that soc ket-outlets may be used for spec ific items of electrical equipment, such as dishwashers, room heaters or clothes dryers,  the actual load o f the equipment should be substituted.  10 Fixed and stationary appliances may be connected permanently  or through socket- outlets.   AS/NZS 3000:2018  486    COPYRIGHT  C6   GUIDE TO MAXIMUM NUMBE R OF CABLES INSTALLED IN  CONDUITS  C6.1   General  This information is intended to be used as a guide for determin ing the  number of cables and circuits that  may be installed, without da mage, in  conduits and other forms of wiring enclosure.  C6.2   Basis of calculations  The number of cables that can be installed in a circular condui t is  determined from the ratios of the cross-sectional areas of the enclosure and  the cable as follows:   - -\uf03d\uf0b4internal cross sectional areaof enclosureNumber of cables space factorcross sectional area of cable where the space factor recognize s the reduction of space availa ble from the  circular geometry of the cables and enclosures.  (a) For one cable in enclosure ................................ ............................. 0.5.  (b) For two cables  in enclosure ............................... .......................... 0.33.  (c) For three or more cables in enc losure ..................... ....................... 0.4.  Tables C10 to C12 demonstrate the application of the equation f or  combinations of common conduit and cable types.  C6.3   Application notes  Cable types and sizes used in Tables C10 to C12 are based on  manufacturer\u2019s catalogue nominal sizes for cables conforming to   AS/NZS 5000.1 and AS/NZ S 5000.2. For common building cable type s,  such as two-core and earth flat PVC/PVC V90 cables, the number of cables  has increased because of the smaller cable dimensions of the 45 0/750 V  rated cables.  The conduit sizes and types used in Tables C10 to C12 are based  on  nominal bore dimensions deter mined from AS/NZS 2053.2 (rigid UP VC),  AS/NZS 2053.5 (corr ugated) and AS/NZS 2053.6 (profile wall smoo th bore).  The calculation method may also be applied to ot her combination s of  circular and non-circular enclosures, and cables of different t ypes and sizes  within the same enclosure, pro vided that the shape of the cable s and  enclosures are compatible.  The number of cables determined by  the calculation assumes that  the  enclosure is relatively short in length, is clear of obstructio ns and  distortions, and that the quantit y and arrangement of impedimen ts, such as  bends, is minimized. Where this is not the case, the number of cables  should be reduced and measures tak en to ensure that the maximum  cable  pulling tension and bending radius are not exceeded.    487 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  The calculation for the number of cables does not consider the effects of  grouping cables on current-carrying capacity, temperature rise and voltage  drop. AS/NZS 3008 provides de-ra ting factors for grouping that need to be  considered in determining th e suitability of circuits.

(c) in case of a non-current-limit ing device\u2014have a rated short -time  withstand current ( Icw) equal to or higher than t he reference design?  (d) fulfil the requirements of c o-ordination with upstream and downstream  devices (see 9.3.4)?  (e) have equal or smaller critical  distances (safety perimeter)  t o  t h e   reference design?  (f) maintain identical mechanical orientation, including the di rection and  position of venting of the arc chutes?  NOTE   Short-circuit protective devices of the same manufacture r but of a  different series, or devices from a different manufacturer, may  be considered  equivalent and be substituted for the original device if the re quirements of the  device manufacturer are complied with and the device manufactur er declares  the performance characteristics to be the same or better in all  relevant respects  to the series used for verification, for example, breaking capa city limitation  characteristics ( I2t, Ipk) and the critical distances (safety perimeters).\u2019  K11   REPAIRS TO EXISTING SWITCHBOARDS  Where repairs are needed to an ex isting switchboard and the ori ginal  devices are no longer available,  and equivalent devices suitabl e for the  installation conditions are fitt ed, then the requirements for r epairs in this  Standard apply.  In doing this, the principles of device substitution may be tak en into account  as per Paragraph K10.    557 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  K12   ROUTINE VERIFICATION BY THE SWITCHBOARD  MANUFACTURER  Routine verification is intended to detect faults in materials and  workmanship and to ascertain pr oper functioning of the manufact ured  ASSEMBLY. It is made on every ASSEMBLY during and/or after  manufacture.  Where appropriate, routine verification confirms that design ve rification is  available.  Routine verification does not need to be carried out on devices  and self- contained components incorporated in the ASSEMBLY when they com ply  with the relevant standards, and have been selected in accordan ce with  Clause 8.5.3 of this Standard, and are installed in accordance with the  instructions of the device manufacturer.  Verification comprises the following categories that are taken from  Clauses 11.2 to 11.8 of AS/NZS 61439.1:2016:  (a) Degree of protection of enclosures.  (b) Clearances and creepage distances.  (c) Protection against electric s hock and integrity of protecti ve circuits.  (d) Incorporation of built-in components.  (e) Internal electrical circuits and connections.  (f) Terminals for external conductors.  (g) Mechanical operation.  (h) Performance (see Clauses 11.9 and 11.10 of AS/NZS 61439.1:2 016).  (i) Dielectric properties, wiri ng, operational performance and function.

Where the owner or operator of an installation or part of an in stallation has  identified it beneficial for the installation or part thereof t o include features  to reduce the impact of power supply outages and to provide con tinuity of  supply for active assisted living and homecare medical situatio ns, this  Appendix gives guidance so that t he electrical installation wil l function  correctly for the purpose intended, and take into account the m itigation of  foreseeable adverse effects tha t  disruption to power supply ma y cause.  M1.2   Active assisted living  Active assisted living (AAL) syst ems and services enable indepe ndent living  through the use of information and communications technology (I CT) by  ensuring usability, accessibilit y, interoperability, security a nd safety for all  users. Household automation pl ays a large part in this.  M1.3   Homecare medical  Home-based medical procedures such as dialysis, respiratory sup port and  cardiac care are becoming commonplace. Allied to this is the gr owing use  of tele-monitoring, which is the remote collection and transmis sion of data  so that it can be interpreted and used for ongoing patient mana gement.  M2   ARRANGEMENTS  The following steps are provid ed to supplement the requirements  o f  t h i s   Standard for active assisted liv ing and homecare  medical applic ations:  (a) Enrol the electrical installation for the priority restorat ion in the event  of supply failure with the electr icity retailer and/or electric ity distributor  providing the power supply to t he electrical installation.  (b) Ensure that all trees have sufficient clearance from the ae rial  conductors to prevent damage to, or  the interruption of the ele ctrical  supply, if the supply to the ele ctrical installation is by aeri al  *   AS/NZS 3000:2018  560    COPYRIGHT  conductors. Further inspections s hould be carried out at approp riate  intervals and corrective ac tion taken, if required.  (c) Provide full discrimination throughout the electrical insta llation  (see Clause 2.5.7).  (d) Ensure that the capacity of the consumer mains, switchboard s and  final subcircuit wiring is able to supply the expected maximum loading  of the electrical installation.  (e) Use miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) or residual current b reaker with  overload (RCBO) for overcurrent p rotection in domestic installa tions,  as they require no additional parts to carry out repair. A MCB or RCBO  is able to be reset easily without live terminals being exposed . They  also give a visual indication that they have tripped, making  identification and restorat ion a simple process.  (f) Use a portable Type 1, 10 mA  RCD for each item of medical  equipment in home care areas of a domestic electrical installat ion.  These RCDs enable the use of another operating socket-outlet to   maintain supply in the event of a switchboard mounted MCB or RC D  tripping;  (g) Ensure constant charging of the batteries to maintain full charge for  power supply equipment fitted wit h batteries as energy storage.   Regular maintenance of the batteries should be carried out to t he  battery manufacturers\u2019 instructions.  NOTE: The maintenance of batteries fitted to medical equipment to provide  continued operation in the event of power supply failure is con sidered to be  part of the medical equipment maintenance arrangements.  (h) Provide for an easy connection of a portable generating set  ( l o c a te d   outside due to the generating se t exhaust gases and combustion and  cooling air requirements) by us e of an extension cord, dedicate d  socket-outlet wiring in the electrical installation or changeov er switch  for the connection to the electrical installation. These are ty pical  methods that can be used to cover  extended period of supply fai lure.  NOTES:   1 A grid connected inverter is not able to use the output from a PV array  when the normal mains supply to the electrical installation has  failed.  2 An inverter or UPS powered from a large battery may be able t o provide  an alternative power supply cover for a short term supply failu re.  (i) Put in place arrangements to cater for medical evacuation t o a suitable  site which is able to provide a long term alternative power sup ply.      561 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  APPENDIX   N  ELECTRICAL CONDUITS  (Informative)  N1   GENERAL  There are two series of Standards for electrical conduits that run in parallel  within Australia and New Zealand.

Guidance is also provided on the following:  (a) Coordination of the characteristics of conductors and prote ctive  devices for protection against overload current.  (b) Automatic disconnection of supply to provide fault protecti on, including  determination of maximum earth fault-loop impedance and maximum   length of a circuit that will al low a protective device to oper ate within  the specified disconnection time.

The most common distribution a rrangement for a low-voltage elec trical  installation is radial branched distribution, an example of whi ch is shown in  Figure B1.  The steps that should be taken to  ensure correct circuit arrang ements are  as follows:  (a) Determine the required current -carrying capacity, in accord ance with  the AS/NZS 3008.1 series, for circuit conductors dependent on t he  method of installation and the pr esence of external influences.   (b) Determine overcurrent requirements, in accordance with Clau se 2.5.  Overcurrent includes both overl oad currents and short-circuit c urrents  (see Paragraph B3).  (c) Determine voltage drop requi rements, in accordance with Cla use 3.6.  NOTE: Guidance on the calculation of voltage drop is given in t he  AS/NZS 3008.1 series.

The danger to the system from ov erload currents is that the tem perature of  conductors and their insulation will rise to levels at which th e effectiveness  of the insulation and its expecte d service life will be reduced .  Short-circuit currents may be up to several thousand times norm al current  and will cause overheating and me chanical stresses of conductor s and  associated connections.  NOTE: See Clause 2.5.4 and the AS/NZS 3008.1 series.  Clause 2.5.1 requires active c onductors to be protected by one or more  protective devices in the ev ent of overload or short-circuit.  The protection of conductors by protective devices is shown gra phically in  Figure B2.

B4   PROTECTION BY AUTOMATIC  DISCONNECTION OF SUPPLY  B4.1   Application  This Paragraph (Paragraph B4) pr ovides guidance on the applicat ion of\u2014  (a) the disconnection times requir ed for protection by automati c  disconnection of supply;  (b) the earthing system impedanc e (earth fault-loop impedance)  requirements of Clause 5.7; and  (c) the earth fault-loop impedance  test outlined in Clause 8.3. 9.3.  B4.2   Principle  The principle of protection by automatic disconnection of suppl y is intended  to prevent a person being subj ected to a dangerous touch voltag e for a time  sufficient to cause organ damage , in the event of an insulation  fault.  In order to meet this requirement, in the event of such a fault , the circuit  protective device has to interrupt the resulting fault current sufficiently  quickly to prevent the touch voltage persisting long enough to be  dangerous.  It follows that this method of protection relies on the combina tion of two  conditions:  (a) The provision of a conducting path, designated the \u2018earth f ault-loop\u2019, to  provide for circulation of the fault current.   AS/NZS 3000:2018  444    COPYRIGHT  (b) The interruption of the fault current within a maximum time  by an  appropriate protective device. This maximum time depends on  parameters such as the highes t touch voltage, the probability o f a  fault, and the probabilit y of a person touc hing equipment durin g a fault.  NOTE: Acceptable limits of touch voltage and duration are based  on a  knowledge of the effects of electric current on the human body described in the  AS/NZS 60479 series.  Condition (a) requires the inst allation of protective earthing conductors  connecting all exposed conductive parts of the electrical equip ment  supplied by the installation to an earthing system, thus formin g the earth  fault-loop as shown in Figure B5 . The protective earthing condu ctors need  to be of appropriate size and ins talled in a sound and reliable  manner, in  accordance with Secti on 5 of this Standard.  Condition (b) requires the inst allation of protective devices w ith appropriate  characteristics as specified in Section 2 of this Standard.  B4.3   Disconnection times  The AS/NZS 60479 series defines t wo components that permit the  establishment of a relationship between the prospective touch v oltage and  its duration that does not usually result in harmful physiologi cal effects on  any person subjected to  that touch voltage.  These two components are\u2014  (a) the effect on the human body o f electrical currents of vari ous  magnitudes and durations flow ing through the body; and  (b) the electrical impedance of the human body as a function of  touch  voltage.  The required relationship between prospective touch voltage and   disconnection time is derived for the normal situation as shown  in Curve L  of Figure B4.  Figure B4 shows the maximum duration that a person may be in co ntact  with an exposed live part of a cir cuit for a range of touch vol tages under  normal conditions (Curve L).  Normal situations were identifi ed as having the following gener al  characteristics:  (i) Dry locations; and  (ii) Floor presenting si gnificant resistance.  Particular situations, includin g damp or wet locations and thos e involving  exposure to wet or bare skin, require touch voltages to be furt her limited as  shown by curve L p. Damp situations are covered in Section 6 of this  Standard.    445 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  10 000 1000 100 10 10 100 1000 LP L DURATION, ms VOLTAGE, V     L for normal conditions touc h voltage limit 50 V  Lp for wet conditions touch voltage limit 25 V  [Source: IEC TR 61200-413:1996 \uf0d3 1996 (IEC), Geneva, Switzerland, www.iec.ch.]  FIGURE  B4   MAXIMUM DURATI ON OF PROSPECTIVE 50 Hz  TOUCH VOLTAGE  These curves demonstrate t hat for normal conditions\u2014  (A) a touch voltage of 50 V can be sustained by a person indefi nitely; and  (B) a touch voltage of 100 V cannot  be sustained and has to be  disconnected.  The required disconnection time  depends on environmental condit ions and  whether a person is likely to be in contact with exposed conduc tive parts at  the time of the fault.  The protective device is selected so that the fault current, IA = Uo/Zs,  ensures its operation in a time t not greater than the required time.  This requires the calculation of the earth fault-loop impedance , Zs, which is  possible only if all the elements of the loop, including the so urce, are  known.  Zs may be calculated if the live and protective earthing conducto rs are in  close proximity to one another and are not separated by ferroma gnetic  material.

Refer to Table 8.1 fo r Zs and Paragraph B5.2  for Zint at 0.8 \uf0b4 Zs.  2 Earth fault loop lengths for circuit-breaker operation are ca lculated for automatic  disconnection of supply in \uf0a30.4 s by operation of the instantaneous trip.   Lengths are calculated for MC Bs (AS/NZS 60898 series) and RCBO s  (AS/NZS 61009) C curve (7.5 \uf0b4 IN) and also apply to MCCBs (AS/NZS 60947.2) with  instantaneous settings equivalent to C curve.  To convert C curve (7.5 \uf0b4 IN) lengths to B curve (4 \uf0b4 IN) lengths multiply by 1.87, or for D curve (12.5 \uf0b4 IN) lengths, multiply by 0.6.  3 Voltage drop (VD) route lengths are calculated at 0.8 \uf0b4 IN using data from AS/NZS 3008.1.1:2017, Table 41, 60\u00b0C Vc values for active and neutral conductor  sizes.   For an example of the calculation at 0.8 \uf0b4 20A, 4% Vd, 33 m see B5.2.4.  If the current is not 0.8 \uf0b4 IN a re-calculation is required using the new current and Vc for the resulting conductor temperature. Example calculation fo r 1 \uf0b4 IN values: 1 \uf0b4 20A  (75\u00b0C, Vc 15.6) L = 33 \uf0b4 14.9/15.6 \uf0b4 16/20 = 25 m. This compares to 33 m for 0.8 \uf0b4 IN. The ratio 25/33 = 0.76 can be applied to convert 0.8 \uf0b4 IN values in the table to 1 \uf0b4 IN values or use the simplified method in Paragraph C4, Appendix C  which is for 1 \uf0b4 IN.  For voltage drop loop length on di stributed circuits, refer to Clause 3.6.2, exception 1. 4 Voltage drop route lengths are for final subcircuits (e.g. 3% ) and the voltage drop  from the point of supply to the start of the final subcircuit m ust be added (e.g. 2%)  and not exceed 5% as require d by Clause 3.6.2.   The earth fault loop route lengths for final subcircuits will satisfy the requirements of  Clauses 1.5.5.3, 5.7  and 8.3.9 for automat ic disconnection of s upply for the conditions  of Paragraph B5.2.2 and may be used for compliance of final sub circuits but must not  exceed the voltage drop loop length.  To comply with both earth fault loop and voltage drop route len gth the shortest route  length is required.  For example, the route length fo r 3% voltage drop, single phase  is always less than  the earth fault loop length and overrides the EFL values.    *   AS/NZS 3000:2018  456    COPYRIGHT  APPENDIX   C  CIRCUIT ARRA NGEMENTS  (Informative)  C1   SCOPE  This Appendix provides guidance on the following:  (a) Determination of the circuit c urrent for consumer mains, su bmains and  final subcircuits.  (b) Cable selection based on cu rrent-carrying capacity and volt age drop.  (c) Coordination of current rat ings of circuit cables and prote ctive devices.  (d) Division of installation into circuits supplying single and  multiple items  of equipment, as necessary, to provide satisfactory performance  o f   circuits for the purpose intended.  (e) Cable installation.  These are the factors that dete rmine the arrangement of circuit s in an  installation that is deemed to m eet the design, equipment selec tion and  installation criteri a of this Standard.  C2   MAXIMUM DEMAND  C2.1   After diversity maximum demand  As indicated in Clause 2.5.3, t he current in a circuit is not p ermitted to  exceed the current rating of the  circuit protective device, whi ch, in turn, is  not permitted to exceed the current-carrying capacity of the ci rcuit  conductors.  NOTE: Paragraph B3.2 of Appendix B explains further.  For circuits supplying a single item of equipment, the circuit current is  simply the nominal load current o f the equipment, e.g. a 10 000  W  230/400 V three-phase heater has a full per-phase load current of 14.5 A.  The circuit conductors and the protective device are required t o have a  current-carrying capacity of not less than 16 A (nearest standa rd rating).  Where more than one item of equipment is connected, the circuit  current  could be assessed as the sum of  the individual equipment load c urrents.  While this would provide a safe and conservative solution, it d oes not take  account of the normal operating conditions during which all equ ipment is  not operating simultaneously at full load or for long periods, e.g. submains  to a distribution board associat ed with numerous socket-outlet circuits.  Under such conditions, the circuit current is estimated using d iversity  factors and is often described as  the \u2018after diversity maximum demand\u2019.    457 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  The diversity factors applicable to any given circuit in an ins tallation will  depend on a number of features of the installation including\u2014  (a) conditions under which the installation is expected to be u sed,  e.g. residential com pared with commercial;  (b) operating characteristics of the connected load, e.g. airco nditioning  load in tropical locations compa red with heating loads in cold- climate  regions;  (c) number and physical distribu tion of points provided on the circuit,  e.g. socket-outlets provided for  convenient connection of porta ble  equipment compared to dedicat ed or fixed equipment loads; and  (d) size and type of significan t loads, e.g. large motors or in dustrial plant.  It should be recognized that the determination of diversity fac tors given in  this Appendix will not be accurate for every installation and d ifferent  installations of the same type may have significantly different  load profiles  which the designer needs to consider. The methods provided here in have  been used over several editions o f this Standard and, provided that care is  taken to assess the presence of unusual equipment loads, are co nsidered  appropriate for many typical applications.  When the load is assessed and t he current-carrying capacity of the circuit is  determined by allowing for divers ity of operation of equipment,  then the  circuit should be protected by a circuit-breaker of rating to c onform with  Paragraph B3.2 of Appendix B.

Table D2, Column 8 shows that for a 1 \uf0b4 4 core, 16 mm 2 hard-drawn  insulated copper aerial cable with a 20 metre span, the minimum  post/pole  strength rating is S18.  Tables D3, D5, D6 and D10 to D13 show the minimum strength rati ngs and  cross-sectional areas of various poles and post types for given  free length  to lowest conductor support.  NOTE: The free length to lowest conductor support = minimum hei ght above  ground + maximum sag.    497 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  For this example, any of the fo llowing would meet the specifica tions:  (a) If a square sawn hardwood post is selected, then Table D3 s hows  that, for a free length to the lowest conductor of 5.2 m with a  minimum  strength of S18 and concre ted in ground, a 175 mm \uf0b4 175 mm sawn  hardwood post is needed (this has a  strength rating of S21).  Then the post needed is a 6.90 m \uf0b4 175 mm \uf0b4 175 mm sawn  hardwood (S21).  (b) If a cut round hardwood pole is selected, Tables D5 and D6 show that  for a free length to the lowest conductor of 5.2 m with size re duced  from the base of 8 m/2 kN pole, an S23 pole is needed. For 8 m/ 2 kN  pole with the size reduced from t he top, an S24 pole is needed.  Note  that a 2 kN pole may be used, as Table D2 Column 6 shows that, for  this example, the nominal aer ial tension is 1.35 kN.  Thus the pole needed is either an S23, 8 m pole reduced from th e  base to 6.90 m or an S24, 8 m pole reduced from the top to 6.90  m.  (c) If Grade 250 steel pipe is sel ected, Table D10 shows that f or a free  length to the lowest conductor of 5.2 m and a minimum strength rating  of S18, a pipe of 140 mm diameter \uf0b4 5.0 mm wall thickness is needed.  This has an S20 rating.  Thus the post needed is a 6.90 m \uf0b4 140 mm \uf0c6 \uf0b4 5.0 mm wall  thickness (S20) Grade 250 steel pipe.  (d) If Grade 350 steel pipe is sel ected, Table D11 shows that f or a free  length to the lowest conductor of 5.2 m and a minimum strength rating  of S18, a pipe of 140 mm diameter  and 3.5 mm wall thickness is  needed. This has an S19 rating.  Thus the post needed is 6.90 m \uf0b4 140 mm \uf0c6 \uf0b4 3.5 mm wall thickness  (S19) Grade 350 steel pipe.  (e) If Grade 350 steel square sect ion is selected, Table D12(B)  shows that  for a free length to the lowest conductor of 5.2 m and a minimu m  strength rating of S18, a post of 100 mm \uf0b4 100 mm \uf0b4 9 mm wall  thickness is needed. This has an S20 rating.  Thus the post needed is 6.90 m \uf0b4 100 mm \uf0b4 100 mm \uf0b4 9.0 mm wall  thickness (S20) Grade 350 steel section.  (f) If Grade 450 steel square sect ion is selected, Table D13(B)  shows that  for a free length to the lowest conductor of 5.2 m and a minimu m  strength rating of S18, there is  no suitable size available.

Substitution of appropriately tested s upports and  fixings of equivalent or greater c lassification and load capaci ty are  acceptable.  H2   PARTICULAR WIRING SYSTEM APPLICATIONS  H2.1   Building Code  The Building Code of Australia (NCC Volume 1) requires wiring s ystems  supplying a substation or main switchboard, that supplies equip ment  A   535 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  required to operate in an emer gency mode, to have a wiring syst em rating  of\u2014  (a) WS53W, if located in a posit ion subject to damage by motor vehicles;  (b) WS52W, elsewhere; or  (c) otherwise enclosed or protected by construction having a   fire-resistance level o f not less than120/120/120.  H2.2   Equipment installation Standards  Standards that include requirement s for wiring systems with fir e or  mechanical protection include, without limitation, the followin g:  AS/NZS 1668.1, The use of ventilation and airconditioning in buildings ,  Part 1: Fire and smoke control in buildings , requires a wiring system rating  of WS5X for circuits supplying equ ipment required to operate in  a    smoke-control mode.  AS 1670.1, Fire detection, warning, control and intercom systems\u2014System  design, installa tion and commissioning , Part 1: Fire, requires a wiring  system mechanical rating of WSX2 for  signal circuits and WS51W for fire  rated circuits, e.g. incoming telcommunications connection, ass ociated with  fire detection and alarm system signals.  AS 1670.4, Fire detection, warning, control and intercom systems\u2014System  design, installation and commissioning , Part 4: Sound systems and  intercom systems for emergency purposes , requires a wiring system rating  of WS51W for intercom and sound system equipment circuits betwe en fire  compartments.  AS 2118 series, Automatic fire sprinkler systems .

NZS 4512, Fire detection and alarm systems in buildings , requires a wiring  system rating of\u2014  (i) WS11 for incoming tele communications connection; and   AS/NZS 3000:2018  536    COPYRIGHT  (ii) WS51W for intercom and so und system equipment circuits bet ween  fire compartments.  H3   FIRE-PROTECTE D WIRING SYSTEMS  A wiring system can be provided with protection against exposur e to fire in  the following two ways:  (a) The use of unenclosed or enclosed wiring systems classified  i n   accordance with AS/NZS 3013 and not depending on fire-rated  elements of building construc tion for thermal protection.  (b) The use of fire-rated elements of building construction to provide  thermal protection to wiring systems not complying with the  requirements of AS/NZS 3013 for t he degree of protection requir ed.  H4   MECHANICALLY PROTECTED WIRING SYSTEMS  H4.1   General  Mechanical protection is provi ded to prevent accidental damage.   Accordingly, the approach should in volve the provision of a pro tection  system with the minimum number of protrusions that are likely t o catch or  cause damage to vehicles or injury to persons. At the same time , the  mechanical protection system needs to provide adequate mechanic al  protection to prevent damage by c ontact with vehicles or person s.  In the installation of these systems, a primary consideration s hould be that,  where possible, the wiring system l ocation should be chosen to restrict or to  prevent the approach of any obj ect likely to cause damage. Gene rally, this  may be in protected corners or in some area away from the traff ic that may  cause the damage. Where such a loc ation is not possible, furthe r protection  is to be provided.  Wiring systems can be\u2014  (a) unenclosed (where the protection is an integral part of the  cable or  busway); or  (b) enclosed (where a protective  cover is provided outside the wiring  system).  The impact and cutting energies f or the various classification levels are  specified in AS/NZS 3013.  Non-metallic materials may be expected to provide mechanical pr otection  over a temperature range of \uf02d15\u00b0C to +60\u00b0C. The manufacturer may certify  extended or reduced ranges that s hould be externally marked on the  protection system.  H4.2   Application of wiring systems  Wiring systems that maintain t heir circuit integrity under cond itions of  mechanical damage may be used as indicated below. The following     537 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  examples are general indicati ons only because the frequency and  level of  impact in any particular applicat ion is difficult to determine:   (a) WSX1   In internal domestic or office situations where some damage is  considered likely.  (b) WSX2   In passageways in domestic, office and commercial locations  where impact by hand trucks and barrows is considered likely.  (c) WSX3   In car parks and driveways where occasional impact of cars o r  light vehicles is possible.  (d) WSX4   In areas where impact by vehicles not exceeding two tonnes  but with solid frames is likely.  (e) WSX5   In areas where impact by laden trucks exceeding two tonnes  is likely.  NOTES:   1 Classified wiring systems are tested to withstand the above i mpact  conditions. However, repeated impacts of these levels could lea d to failure  of the wiring system.  2 Impact energies for the higher classification are severe so t hat every effort  should be made to avoid routing wiring through such areas.  H4.3   Unenclosed wiring systems  For unenclosed wiring systems, mechanically protected cables an d  busways complying with the require ments of AS/NZS 3013 should b e  selected. All components used i n such wiring systems should be tested to  be in accordance with  the appropriate require ments of AS/NZS 30 13.  H4.4   Enclosed wiring systems  The following recommendations appl y to enclosed wiring systems:   (a) If mechanical protection of the wiring system is achieved b y an  additional enclosure, the prot ection may be in the form of\u2014  (i) a complete enclosure, such as a conduit, pipe, trunking or other  housing; or  (ii) a barrier that is interpos ed between the wiring system and  the  possible source of impact.  In both cases, the protection needs to be capable of resisting the  impact load.  (b) If cables are contained in c onduit or piping, such enclosur e should be  type tested for the impact energy  and ambient temperature range  o f   the location in which it is installed.  (c) If cables are installed in a cable trunking, on a cable tra y with covers,  or in a similar m anner, the enclosure should be type tested.   AS/NZS 3000:2018  538    COPYRIGHT  (d) Enclosed wiring systems for Classifications WSX1, WSX2 and WSX3  should be type-tested. While wiring systems for Classifications  WSX4  and WSX5 can be type-tested, it is  anticipated that these enclo sures  will be designed by a s tructural engineer.

K6.8   Current rating by testing and temperature limits  Clause 10.10 and Table 6 of AS/ NZS 61439.1:2016 provide current - carrying capacity requirements t hat are to be satisfied by rate d current of  the switchboard ASSEMBLY ( I nA), rated current of outgoing circuits ( Inc),  and maximum demand after diversity factor (RDF). These requirem ents  may meet the requirem ents of this Standard.  This test from AS/NZS 61439.1 establishes the following:  (a) That I nA is the rated current of the ASSEMBLY and the current that the  busbar is capable of distr ibuting, for example, InA = 1600 A.  (b) That Inc is the maximum rated current o f an individual circuit, for  example, Inc = 534 A for a MCCB marked In 630 A.   AS/NZS 3000:2018  552    COPYRIGHT  NOTE: The In marked rating, that is tested to AS/NZS 60947.2 in free air,  may differ (need derating) to achieve Inc. That is, Inc of 534 A is equal to 0.85  multiplied by In of 630 A.  (c) That RDF (rated diversity factor), for example\u2014  I = 0.9 \uf0b4 Inc   = 0.9 \uf0b4 534   = 481 A per circuit  where  RDF= 0.9 for three outgoing circuits.  Thus, the total current after diversity for the three  circuits = 3 \uf0b4 481 = 1443 A.  Another example\u2014  I = Inc = 481 per circuit; and  RDF = 1 for three outgoing circuits  Thus, the total current after diversity for the three  circuits = 3 \uf0b4 481 = 1443 A.  NOTES:   1 RDF is the per unit value of the rated current, assigned by t he  ASSEMBLY manufacturer, to which outgoing circuits of an ASSEMBL Y  can be continuously and simultaneously loaded, taking into acco unt the  mutual thermal influences.  2 RDF should be equal to or higher than the value of assumed lo ading  factor from Table 101 of AS/NZS 61439.2:2016 and  AS/NZS 61439.3:2016.   For example, an assumed loading factor for three circuits, In = 0.9,  Table 101 of AS/NZS 61439.2:2016 and In = 0.8 Table 101 o f  AS/NZS 61439.3.   For guidance and examples, refer to AS/NZS 61439.1:2016, Annex  E,  Paragraph E2.  3 The assumed loading factor from Table 101 of AS/NZS 61439.2:2 016  and after diversity maximum demand from Appendix C, Paragraph C 2 of  this Standard are the same in principle.  (d) The derating influences for current ratings for InA, Inc and RDF.  In is the marked current rating on a device tested in free air. T he air  temperature rise inside the sw itchboard is higher than the outs ide  ambient temperature and depends on the heating from equipment,  such as busbars, circuit-breakers and fuses. Tests for Inc and RDF are  with the ASSEMBLY carrying InA. The ventilation and the IP rating  affect the inside air temperature rise. The minimum IP rating f or a PSC  ASSEMBLY is IP2X and for a DBO is IP2XC. For example, a rating of  IP5X will need to be derated if the original test was at IP2X. Refer to    553 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  AS/NZS 61439.1:2016, Clauses 10.10.3, 10.10.4, Annex O and  AS 60890 for further details  of derating influences.  The reference air ambient temperature for In value to AS/NZS 60947,  and switchboards construc ted to AS/NZS 61439 ( InA) and Inc is 35\u00b0C  averaged over 24 h with a maximum of 40\u00b0C.  The derating factors for circuit-breakers and fuses for various   temperatures is availabl e from the manufacturer.  (e) An explanation of terminal temperature and cable-rated temp erature.  The allowable limit for terminals for outgoing insulated conduc tors is  70 K (Table 6 of AS/NZS 61439.1: 2016) at the reference ambient  temperature of 35\u00b0C givi ng 105\u00b0C on the terminal.  V75 cables may be connected to these terminals on the basis tha t if  cables are separated at the terminal and for a deemed distance of  100 mm, then it is at this point t hat insulation is required. T he  temperature of the insulation at  this point is deemed not to ex ceed the  allowed insulation temper ature rating of 75\u00b0C.  K6.9   Derivation of ratings for  similar variants to AS/NZS 614 39.1  Clause 10.10.3 of AS/ NZS 61439.1:2016 shows how the rated curre nts of  variants may be verified by derivation for similar arrangements  that have  been verified by test.  K6.10   Verification asses sment to AS/NZS 61439.1  Clause 10.10.4 of AS/NZ S 61439.1:2016 provid es information on t he  calculation procedur e and limitations.  Annex N of AS/NZS 61439.1:2016 and AS 60890 provide operating c urrent  and power loss of copper conductors.  For verification by calculation , the copper busbar design tempe rature  should not exceed 90\u00b0C unless bas ed on a tested reference desig n.  Verification by test may give higher ratings than verification assessment for  the same busbar size.  K7   SHORT-CIRCUIT WI THSTAND STRENGTH  K7.1   General  In Clause 10.11.2 of AS/NZS 61439. 1:2016, ASSEMBLIES for instal lation  with prospective currents ( Icp) exceeding 10 kA r.m.s  or if protected by  devices with a cut-off peak current ( Ipk) exceeding 17 kA need to be tested.  K7.2   Ratings  K7.2.1    Short time withstand current rating (I cw)  The following is an example fo r rating of short time withstand current:  Icw = 25 kA for 0.1 s with I peak of 52.5 kA.   AS/NZS 3000:2018  554    COPYRIGHT  K7.2.2    Backup (cascading)  Clause 2.5.4.2, Item (a), and Cl ause 2.5.7.2.1 of this Standard  p r o v i d e   information on backup (cascading).  For further guidance, consult manufacturers\u2019 tables for values to determine  if a device with a short-circuit rating less than the prospecti ve short-circuit  current and protected by an upstr eam device, rated for the pros pective  short-circuit current, that, in  association with a downsteam de vice, limits Ipk  and I2t to a value that can be used to comply with Item (a) of Clause 2.5.4.2  of this Standard.  K7.3   Short-circuit withstand strength by comparison to a refe rence  design utilizing a check list  See AS/NZS 61439.1:2016, Clause 10.11.3 and Table 13 (including   Australian/New Zealand variatio ns in Appendix ZA), for relevant  details.  Explanation of short-circuit wi thstand strength by comparison t o a reference  design using a check list, is best demonstrated through an exam ple. Thus,  an ASSEMBLY of modular pretested items such as busbars, busbar  supports and connections, incoming and outgoing units, and the like that  have already been proven by test as modules under the condition s required  for the switchboard to comply with Clause 10.11. 3 are suitable if Table 13  of AS/NZS 61439.1:2016 require ments are satisfied.  K8   MARKING  K8.1   PSC and DBO switchboards  The marking for PSC and DBO swit chboards is found in Clause 6.1  of the  AS/NZS 61439 series. Those ma rkings that apply are\u2014  (a) ASSEMBLY manufacture r\u2019s name or trademark;  (b) type designation or identification, or other means of ident ification;  (c) date of manufacture; and  (d) AS/NZS 61439.X (X = 1, 2 or 3).  The recommended additional marking for PSC switchboards is form  o f   separation, for example, form 3b, and the applicable IP rating,  for example,  IP2X or IPXXB.  K8.2   Additional marking for DBO  The following additional marking provisions for a DBO are found  i n   Clause 6.1 of AS/NZS 61439.3:2016:  (a) I nA, for example, InA 250 A.  (b) IP, when greater than IP2XC, for example, IP4X.

Fire ignition by arc faults is normally a result of one or more  of the  following:  (a) Insulation defects between live conductors leading to fault  currents  (parallel arcs).  (b) Broken or damaged (reduced c ross-section) conductors under load  current conditions (series arcs).  (c) Terminal connections with high resistance.  Arc fault detection devices installed in final subcircuits are capable of  detecting fault conditions that r esult from damaged cables with in the  installation wiring or damaged fl exible cords of electrical equ ipment plugged  into socket-outlets within the installation.  NOTE: There are also other types of arcing fault devices used t o mitigate the  risk of igniting an electrical fire and or causing an electrica l explosion in high- current circuits, high-current LV switchboards and HV switchboa rds, and it  should be noted these are not the AFDDs described in this Appen dix.  There are two types of arc faults:  (i) Series arcing faults    An electrical arc within a single active or neutral  conductor, in series with the connected load (see Figure O1).  (ii) Parallel arcing faults    An electrical arc between an active and a  neutral conductor, or between two a ctive conductors of differen t  phases, or between a live conductor and the protective conducto r, in  parallel with the connected load (see Figure O1).   AS/NZS 3000:2018  566    COPYRIGHT  Series Parallel Line conductor\u2014Neutral/Lin e conductor\u2014Line conductor Parallel Line conductor\u2014Protective conductor LOAD L N LOAD L N LOAD L N   FIGURE  O1   TYPES OF ARC FAULT  Miniature overcurrent circuit b reakers (MCBs), fuses, and resid ual current  devices (RCDs) are not capable of  reliably protecting against t he effects of  arcing due to the nature of the ar cing current (including its m agnitude,  frequency spectrum, mode of arc, and sporadic occurrence), and their  response times at the level of current associated with electric al arcing.  AFDDs that do not incorporate integral overcurrent or residual current  protection do not provide protec tion against sustained thermal overloads,  short-circuit currents, or re sidual currents at power frequency .  NOTE: Installations in which the use of AFDDs may be appropriat e include the  following:  (a) Premises with sleeping accommodation.  (b) Premises and locations for children, handicapped or elderly  people,  e.g. day care centres, pre-schools, other schools, retirement o r nursing  homes.  (c) Premises for gathering of people, e.g. theatres, cinemas, c oncert halls,  universities, event locations, restaurants, bars, exhibitions, underground  stations, hospitals commercial centres, shopping malls, office complexes,  etc.  (d) Locations with risks of fire due to the nature of processed  or stored  materials, i.e. locations, such as barns, wood-working shops, s tores of  combustible materials.  (e) Locations constructed with combustible materials, e.g. wood en buildings.  (f) Fire propagating structures.  (g) Locations where irreplaceable goods are stored or displayed  and may be  endangered, e.g. museums, galleries, etc.  O2   CHARACTERISTICS OF AFDDs  Refer to IEC 62606.    567 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  O3   GENERAL REQUIR EMENTS FOR AFDDs  Refer to IEC 62606.  O4   LOCATION, SELECTION AND  INSTALLATION OF AFDDs  O4.1   Location  Where used, an AFDD should be lo cated at the origin of the circ uit to be  protected. The use of AFDDs does  not obviate the requirement to  apply one  or more of the measures provided in other clauses of this Stand ard.  O4.2   Selection of AFDDs  Where used, an AFDD should be sel ected to suit the nominal volt age,  frequency, current and short-circui t current to which it may be  subjected.  Selection of AFDDs which comply with IEC 62606 will satisfy thi s  recommendation.  O4.3   Installation  The requirements of t his Standard apply to the installation of AFDDs.  Where used, AFDDs should be installed as follows:  (a) After the main switch.  (b) At the origin of the circui t to be protected as follows:  (i) Where the AFDD does not include integral short-circuit prot ection  or residual current protection, it is to be installed in series  with a  device or devices complying wit h one of the following Standards :  (A) AS/NZS 60898 series.  (B) AS/NZS 3111.  (C) AS/NZS 61009.1.  (D) AS/NZS 3190 or t he IEC 60269 series.  (ii) The short-circuit making an d breaking capacity of the AFDD  i s   not to be less than the prospective  short-circuit current at th e  point of installation.  (c) To protect the circuits most at risk, such as final subcirc uit supplying  socket-outlets.  O4.4   Overvoltage protection  As AFDDs incorporate sensitive electronic components  (e.g. microcontrollers), consideration should be given to the p rovision of  overvoltage protec tion.

Where a charging cable may come  into contact with the ground (s uch as  soil, concrete, asphalt, stone, etc.) the ground surface should  be of such a  nature that the outer sheath of t he charging cables is not dama ged.  Consideration should  be given to using ea rth-screened cable.  NOTE: Rough surfaces on concrete or rough asphalt are examples of surfaces  where the outer sheath of the cable can be significantly damage d. This can lead  to puncturing of the outer sheath, water penetration and punctu re of the  insulation.  EV charging stations should be designed in accordance with   IEC TS 61439-7.  P7   PERIODIC VERIFICATION  Publicly available EV charging stations should be inspected at least once  per week in order to verify that\u2014  (a) the equipment is not visibly damaged in such a way that the  safety  may be impaired; and  (b) the EV charging station is not showing any indications of o perational  faults or errors.  Publicly available EV charging stations should be inspected at least once  per year to verify co rrect operation.      575 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  APPENDIX   Q  D.C. CIRCUIT PROTECTION  APPLICATION GUIDE  (Informative)  Q1   SCOPE  This Appendix provides  guidance for the sele ction of circuit pr otection and  switching devices operated on a d.c. supply that would be deeme d to meet  the design, equipment selection and installation criteria of th is Standard.  Q2   GENERAL  Where a single contact is used to interrupt the current flow of  a d.c. circuit,  consideration should be given to the size of the contact, the a ir gap, arc  suppression and the use of multiple contacts.  Q3   ARC SUPPRESSION  When a contact carrying d.c. current is opened, an arc is forme d between  each set of contacts as they are opened, and to increase the re sistance of  the arc and to reduce the current flow to zero as quickly as po ssible, an arc  chute for each set of contacts is used to increase the length o f the arc, cool  the arc and to increase the arc resistance until the current fl owing is  reduced to zero.  In some devices, but not all, t he use of a permanent magnet in each arc  chute assembly is used to assist in drawing of the arc into the  arc chute to  increase the length and resist ance of the arc until the current  flow is  reduced to zero.  Q4   SWITCHGEAR TYPES  Q4.1   Polarized  When the d.c. load current can fl ow in only one direction in no rmal or fault  conditions, the use of polarized devices is possible.  Polarized devices are fitted with a permanent magnet to assist in the  magnetic deflection of the arc into the switchgear arc chute to  increase the  arc length when the device contacts are opening. To be able to perform this  deflection function, the magnetic  field in the load-carrying pa rts of the  device should be such that the magnetic field of the magnet is arranged for  the maximum deflection force. T he correct external polarity con nections of  the device will ensure correct operation of the arc deflection forces.  A typical application of a polar ized overcurrent device is a di stribution  switchboard providing a supply to d.c. operated equipment. This   configuration will onl y allow load current to flow in one direc tion.  *   AS/NZS 3000:2018  576    COPYRIGHT  Q4.2   Non-polarized type  When it is possible that the d.c. load current could flow in ei ther direction in  normal or fault conditions, the use of non-polarized devices is  necessary.  As the d.c. current is able to flow in two directions, this mea ns a magnetic  field from a fixed magnet i s not able to be used.  A typical application use of a  non-polarized type device is a b attery  overcurrent device in which the current flow can be in two diff erent  directions; the battery charge current when being float charged , and the  battery when being discharged by  the load and when no output fr om the  d.c. charging source is available.  Q5   D.C. RATINGS  Q5.1   General  All d.c. isolating switches, c ontactors and overcurrent devices  should be  identified as being suitable fo r operation on a d.c. supply. Th e maximum  current and voltage ratings spe cified by the manufacturer shoul d not be  exceeded and the multiple series contact arrangement detailed i n the  manufacturer\u2019s instructions should be used.  For operating voltages above 60 V d.c. (ELV) this will usually require the  use of two or more contacts in series to achieve the specified operating  voltage and current ratings.  Q5.2   Earthed D.C. supply  The d.c. supply may be operated as a separated (isolated) suppl y. All  switching or overload devices s hould operate in all unearthed c onductors;  all multi-pole devices should be linked together so that all co ntacts will  operate substantially together.  One pole of the d.c. supply may be earthed. Any switching devic e may  operate in the unearthed conductor only.  Exception: A multi-pole device is permitted in all conductors (including the  earthed conductor) in this application. All contacts should be linked together  so that all contacts oper ate substantially together.  Q6   PROVISION OF ISOLATION AND  OVERCURRENT PROTECTION  The applicable requirements of S ections 2 to 7 of this Standard  apply for  the provision of isolation and ov ercurrent protection of the d. c. system.  Exception: Earth leakage protection by us e of RCDs is not required, as no  suitable protection devices are currently available.  Q7   SWITCHBOARD LOCATIONS  Clause 2.10 of this Standard specif ies requirements for the loc ation of  switchboards containing a main swit ch and overcurrent devices.    577 AS/NZS 3000:2018     COPYRIGHT  Q8   FINAL SUBCIRCUIT WIRING AND FITTINGS  All wiring for the direct current system should be suitable for  use on a d.c.  supply. Installation requirements are specified in Sections 3 a nd 4 of this  Standard.  If twin cables are not used, all single cables should be positi oned in close  proximity of each other to prov ide cancellation of the magnetic  field when  d.c. current is flowing.  Segregation of 25 mm m inimum should be maintained from all d.c.  cabling  to the a.c. wiring in switchboards  and cabling within the insta llation.  The use of fittings designed solely for use on LV a.c. electric al installations  only should not be used fo r d.c. installations.  All d.c. socket-outlets should be  provided with a d.c. rated co ntrol switch.  The plugs of a.c. operated equipm ent should not be able to ente r socket- outlets connected to the d.c. dis tribution system, or vice vers a.  Q9   INVERTERS  If the d.c. supply system has an inverter providing a 230 V a.c . supply  output, unless the inverter a.c . output is not permanently mark ed as  providing full electrical isola tion from the d.c. input to the a.c. output, all  parts of the d.c. supply system  should be insulated and screene d from  touch for 230 V a.c. operation.  NOTES:   1 An inverter which does not provide for full electrical isolat ion between the  d.c. input and a.c. output, is considered to be a \u2018transformer- less\u2019 or a \u2018non- isolated\u2019 design, and under some fault conditions can result in  the d.c.  supply being raised to the potential of the a.c. output.  2 For a.c. only switch contacts and overcurrent device contacts , all contacts  have a small air gap to ensure the a.c. arc supply current thro ugh the load  current drops down to zero, twice for every cycle of the supply  voltage until  the arc is extinguished. The breaking of d.c. supply current, w hich will draw  an arc across the switch\u2019s opening contacts, requires that the arc increase in  resistance until the current no longer flows (may be effected b y increasing  the length of the arc by the action of magnetic blow-out arcing  contacts). Any  a.c. only switch used in such circumstances on a d.c. supply wi ll be unable  to sufficiently increase the resistance of the continuous arc a cross its  contacts; the likely result will be that the arcing will contin ue until the switch  contacts are destroyed.
