This Appendix explains the reas ons why an earth electrode is no t required or recommended  to be connected to the generator set.  A2   EARTHING OF GENERATING SETS CONNECTED TO AN ELECTRICAL  INSTALLATION BY INSTALLATION WIRING  A2.1   System of supply  Where an electrical installation is arranged to operate from mu ltiple sources of supply   (such as occurs when normally supplied by an electricity distri butor\u2019s network, or  alternatively from a generating set output), the system of supply configuration connected to  the installation loading shall be the same system of supply, e. g. MEN, irrespective of the  supply source.  This means that the connection to earth of the neutral and eart hing connections of the  generating set shall use the same  earthing and neutral bonding connection points in the  electrical installation.   A2.2   Earth electrode  As the electrical installation main switchboard will have an ea rthing system with an earth  electrode in accordance with the requirements of AS/NZS 3000, t he installation of an  additional earth electrode for exclusive use by the generating set is not required.  A2.3   Earth bonding of neutral connection  The bonding of the generating set neutral connection to earth is dependent on the system of  supply required MEN. The connection of the generating set neutr al to the neutral busbar of  the main switchboard MEN is the only connection required.  Figure A1 details the output conn ections required and shows the path of earth fault current  (dotted line) under earth fault conditions located near the load when the generating set is  supplying the load.

The earth fault current flow would be interrupted by the tripping of the generating set  overcurrent protection or final subcircuit protection.  On the occurrence of a fault between the live conductors, fault current will flow in the live  conductors only and trip the overc urrent device in the generating set.

This Appendix does not detail the use of terminals on the generating set as the means of  connection between the generating set and directly connected el ectrical appliances,  electrical equipment or portable tools, as this form of connect ion would require connection  by licensed electrical workers only.  This Appendix also covers the use of reduced low voltage (RLV) to supply electrical tools  operating at 110 V supply at voltages no greater than 55 V (sin gle-phase) or 63.5 V   (three-phase) to earth when the generating set is being used to  power portable tools in  tunnelling locations. Details for r educed low voltage generatin g sets are contained in  Paragraph B5.  B2   PORTABLE GENERATING  SET CONFIGURATIONS  B2.1   System of supply  The system of supply provided by the generating set configurati on should be one of the  following:  (a) Isolated output\u2014single-phase or multi-phase (two-phase or three -phase).  (b) RCD protected output\u2014single-phase or multi-phase (two-phase or three-phase).  (c) Isolated output with enhanced personal protection by use of an insulation monitoring  device (IMD) in accordance with IEC 61557-8.  (d) Isolated output provided by a generator set with an electronic inverter module fitted.  (e) Reduced low voltage (RLV) generating sets.  B2.2   Earthing and equipotential bonding  When a generating set output is arranged to directly supply electrical equipment, such as  electrical appliances and portable tools, the earthing connections of the electrical equipment  and the generating set are arranged to form a common equipotent ial bonding system.   This equipotential bonding arrangement ensures that the correct  operation of overcurrent,  and residual current devices if any, under earth fault conditio ns and that all earth fault  leakage currents are returned to the generating set output conn ections.   The equipotential bonding system additionally provides touch vo ltage control between the  conductive surfaces of the generating set and any electrical equipment fittings being  supplied by the generating set.

As the gener ator output is isolated with  respect to the equipotential bonding system, there is no return  path to the generating set  output and no earth fault current flows.  On the simultaneous occurrence of earth fault 1 and earth fault  2 together, fault current  flows through the earth faults 1 and 2 and would trip the overc urrent device in the  generating set. Figure B3 shows the path of earth fault current  under fault conditions.   On the occurrence of a fault between the live conductors only ( see Figure B3), fault current  will flow in the live conductors only and trip the overcurrent protection device in the  generating set.  If an earth electrode is connected to the generating set frame,  this does not form part of a  low impedance earth fault current loop and hence the provision of this connection to the  mass of earth is not recommended or required. The main earth fault loop is comprised of the  equipotential bonding system and the live conductors.   B2.3.2    RCD protected supply  A neutral to frame connection is fitted on RCD protected output  generating sets only, to  provide the correct operation of  an in-built RCD fitted for per sonal safety purposes.  The RCD Type fitted should correctly operate on the output waveform of the generating set.   The RCD should operate in all liv e conductors, including the neutral connection.  In New Zealand only, the RCD should be of a type for which trip ping is ensured for  residual alternating current and residual pulsating direct current.

On the occurrence of a fault between live conductors (see Figur e B5), fault current will  flow in the live conductors and trip the overcurrent section of  the RCBO (or MCB) in the  generating set.

The IMD should be located in the generating set or be contained in a detachable outlet box  or switchboard.  A typical IMD connection is shown in Figure B6, the IMD should control the output from  the generating set by use of a contactor or shunt trip coil fit ted to the generating set  overcurrent protection MCB.

If the IMD  manufacturer\u2019s instructions specify a different maximum length other than 500 m, that  maximum length should be used.  An IMD fitted in an isolated output generator or a portable soc ket outlet assembly are  shown in Figures B6 and B7 respectively. The connections shown for the IMD are typical  only.

B2.4.2    Socket outlet control switching  The circuit-breaker provided for generating set overcurrent pro tection may be used for the  control for a maximum of two adjacent socket outlets.  If three or more socket outlets are provided on the generating set, or, are contained in a  switchboard fixed or adjacent to the generating set, the following requirements apply:  (a) All socket outlets should be individually controlled by an adja cent control switch.  (b) All switches or overcurrent devices should operate in all live poles (including the  neutral conductor).   (c) The rating of the overcurrent device should not exceed the rati ng of the smallest  rating socket outlet.  (d) The designated earthing terminals of all socket outlets should be connected to the  equipotential bonding conductor and the generating set frame to AS/NZS 3000  requirements for a separated (isolated) supply or RCD protected  supply.  (e) For an attached switchboard only, the total loading of the input to switchboard should  be limited by a switchboard mounted circuit-breaker; the maximum current rating  should be the lesser of the plug rating or the current rating o f the connecting cord to  the supply source.

T here are no limitations to the  number of Class I and Class II electrical equipment that can be  supplied, other than a limit  imposed by the sum of the leakage currents from all operating e lectrical equipment.  B3.3   IMD protected supply   When the generating set output is available the IMD provides co ntinuous monitoring of the  insulation resistance between live parts and equipotential bond ing of the generator set and  the connected loading will detect any insulation failure and th en automatically disconnect  the supply.  There are no limitations to the number of Class I and Class II electrical equipment that can  be supplied, other than a limit imposed by the sum of the insul ation resistance from all  electrical equipment when connected in parallel, and the maximum length of 500 m or the  IMD manufacturer\u2019s maximum cord  length recommendation, whicheve r is the lesser, for the  extension cords connecting the generating set and the connected load.  B3.4   Electronic inverter type supply  The output of an electronic inverter supply has the same limita tions as for Paragraph B3.1.

This allows  for some variations of the requirements detailed above in this appendix to be made for this  type of generating set.  NOTE: See Paragraphs B4.2 to B4.4 for further information.  B4.2   Engine  In periods of light loading, without loads containing motors, t he engine speed may be  reduced to lower the a.c. power input to the inverter module. I n periods of high loading and  when motor starting currents are needed, the engine should run at the normal speed.

The engine coupled mounted generator may also provide an ELV in put to the inverter  module for ELV battery charging.  B4.4   Inverter module  The LV and ELV outputs from the inverter modules may be provided with in-built  electronic overcurrent protection. The fitting of external overcurrent protection devices is  required and may be used as the output isolation switch.

(ii) Type of motor starter used for each motor   Due to the limited maximum  starting current available from a generating set at start up or  when running on  load, this may require use of a reduced current starter.  (iii)  The number of motor(s) starting simultaneously   If a large motor and a number  of smaller motors, starting the large motor first and then arra nging to start the  smaller motors after the large motor is up to full speed adds inertia to the whole  system, reduces the peak kilovolt-ampere required.

In some cases, an excessive voltage  dip may release the motor starter contactor(s) and stop or prev ent starting of the  motors.  (b) Non-linear loading, for example uninterruptable power supplies (UPSs), variable  speed drives and rectifiers with a battery connected. The abili ty of a generator to  supply a non-linear load is dependent on the type of equipment being supplied and the  generating set alternator voltage control system.  (c) Load power factor. To ensure stable output voltage control of t he generating set, the  power factor of the operating load should not have a leading va lue when operating  from generating set output.  NOTE: It may be necessary to remove from service any power fact or correction systems when  the electrical installation is being supplied by a generating s et output, this action being to  prevent the electrical installati on power factor having a leadi ng value.   (d) Absorbing regenerative loading. Generating sets have no ability  to absorb any  regenerated energy that may be produced by a load. Accordingly,  w h e r e  a   regenerating load is supplied by a generating set, it is important to ensure that the  regenerative energy is able to be absorbed by other loads supplied by the installation.
